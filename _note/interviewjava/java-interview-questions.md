## 1. Basics
### 1.1 JVM vs JRE vs JDK
* JVM - Java Virtual Machine: the virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes.
* JRE - Java Runtime Environment: provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applications written in the Java programming language.
* JDK - Java Development Kit: The JDK is a superset of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications.

### 1.2 ClassLoader
Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.

* `Bootstrap ClassLoader`: This is the first classloader which is the superclass of Extension classloader. It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes, etc.
* `Extension ClassLoader`: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loads the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.
* `System/Application ClassLoader`: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the class files from the classpath. By default, the classpath is set to the current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.

### 1.3 Access Modifiers
In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method, class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.

* `public`: The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method.
* `protected`: Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class.
* `default`: Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.
* `private`: The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.

Access Modifiers        | private | default | protected | public
------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------
Inside Class            | Y       | Y       | Y         | Y
Same Package Class      | N       | Y       | Y         | Y
Same Package Sub-Class  | N       | Y       | Y         | Y
Other Package Class     | N       | N       | N         | Y
Other Package Sub-Class | N       | N       | Y         | Y

### 1.4 Difference between Constructor and Method
A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method thatâ€™s called when an instance of an object is created.
* The constructor can't be `final`.
* The constructor can't be inherited.
* The constructor can be overloaded.

Java Constructor                                            | Java Method
------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object. | A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.                  | A method must have a return type, otherwise it will be consider as constructor.
Constructor is invoked implicitly when the `new` keyword creates an object. | Method is invoked explicitly on an object.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class. | Method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
Constructor name must be same as the class name.            | Method name may or may not be same as class name.

### 1.5 Static Method vs Instance Method

static or class method | instance method
-----------------------|-------------------------
A method that is declared as `static` is known as the static method. | A method that is not declared as static is known as the instance method.
We don't need to create the objects to call the static methods. | The object is required to call the instance methods.
Non-static (instance) members cannot be accessed in the static context (static method, static block, and static nested class) directly. | Static and non-static variables both can be accessed in instance methods.

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions
### 2.1 Errors vs Exceptions In Java
Both Errors and Exceptions are the subclasses of `java.lang.Throwable` class.

`Errors` are the conditions which cannot get recovered by any handling techniques. It surely cause termination of the program abnormally. Errors belong to unchecked type and mostly occur at runtime. Some of the examples of errors are Out of memory error or a System crash error.

`Exceptions` are the conditions that occur at runtime and may cause the termination of program. But they are recoverable using try, catch and throw keywords. Exceptions are divided into two categories : `checked` and `unchecked` exceptions. Checked exceptions like IOException known to the compiler at compile time while unchecked exceptions like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException known to the compiler at runtime. It is mostly caused by the program written by the programmer.

Errors                                 | Exceptions
---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------
Recovering from Error is not possible. | We can recover from exceptions by either using try-catch block or throwing exceptions back to caller.
All errors in java are unchecked type. | Exceptions include both checked as well as unchecked type.
Errors are mostly caused by the environment in which program is running. | Program itself is responsible for causing exceptions.
Errors occur at runtime and not known to the compiler. | All exceptions occurs at runtime but checked exceptions are known to compiler while unchecked are not.
They are defined in java.lang.Error package. | They are defined in java.lang.Exception package
Examples: <br> java.lang.StackOverflowError, java.lang.OutOfMemoryError | Examples : <br> Checked Exceptions : SQLException, IOException <br> Unchecked Exceptions :  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException.

### 2.2 Comparable vs Comparator in Java
A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. The class itself must implements the `java.lang.Comparable` interface to compare its instances. Below is the definition of `Comparable` Interface.
```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
    public int compareTo(T o); // the only method
}
```
Below is the definition of `Comparator` Interface.
```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T o1, T o2);
    // other methods
}
```
Example. We define a class named Employee.
```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private int salary;

    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, int salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public int getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    @Override
    //this is overridden to print the user-friendly information about the Employee
    public String toString() {
        return "[id=" + this.id + ", name=" + this.name + ", age=" + this.age + ", salary=" +
                this.salary + "]";
    }
}
```
Then we use this class to create an employee array and use `Arrays.sort()` to sort this array.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create object array
    Employee[] empArr = new Employee[4];
    empArr[0] = new Employee(10, "Johnny", 25, 10000);
    empArr[1] = new Employee(20, "Peter", 29, 20000);
    empArr[2] = new Employee(5, "George", 35, 5000);
    empArr[3] = new Employee(1, "Terry", 32, 50000);

    // Sort employee array using Comparable interface implementation
    Arrays.sort(empArr);
    System.out.println("Sort Employee list with default Comparable interface:\n" + Arrays.toString(empArr));
}
```
We will get following error. This is because the `Arrays.sort()` or `Collections.sort()` method rely on Comparable interface.
```sh
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ClassCastException: johnny.java.compare.Employee cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable
    at java.util.ComparableTimSort.countRunAndMakeAscending(ComparableTimSort.java:320)
    at java.util.ComparableTimSort.sort(ComparableTimSort.java:188)
    at java.util.Arrays.sort(Arrays.java:1246)
    at johnny.java.compare.CompareTest.main(CompareTest.java:17)
```
We need to implement `Comparable` interface in Employee class by overriding the `compareTo` method.
```java
public class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    ...

    public Employee(int id, String name, int age, int salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    ...

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee emp) {
        // sort the employee based on id, in ascending order
        // return negative(less than), zero(equal to), positive(greater than)
        return (this.id - emp.id);
    }
    ...
}
```
Run the test again and we get the following output. Now, we see the employee array is sorted by id in ascending order.
```sh
Sort Employee list with default Comparable interface:
[[id=1, name=Terry, age=32, salary=50000], [id=5, name=George, age=35, salary=5000], [id=10, name=Johnny, age=25, salary=10000], [id=20, name=Peter, age=29, salary=20000]]
```
If we need to sort this array based on different fields, we can use the `Comparator` interface. We can either create a custom comparator in Employee class, like the following example. AgeComparator is a custom comparator base on age.
```java
public class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    ...

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee emp) {
        // sort the employee based on id, in ascending order
        // return negative(less than), zero(equal to), positive(greater than)
        return (this.id - emp.id);
    }

    // Compare employee based on age.
    public static Comparator<Employee> AgeComparator = new Comparator<Employee>() {
        @Override
        public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
            return e1.getAge() - e2.getAge();
        }
    };

    ...
}
```
Or we can create the custom comparator in anywhere. SalaryComparator is a separate class. It compares employee based on salary.
```java
import java.util.Comparator;

public class SalaryComparator implements Comparator<Employee> {
    @Override
    public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
        return e1.getSalary() - e2.getSalary();
    }
}
```
When calling the Arrays.sort method, we can provide a custom comparator as second parameter.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create object array
    Employee[] empArr = new Employee[4];
    empArr[0] = new Employee(10, "Johnny", 25, 10000);
    empArr[1] = new Employee(20, "Peter", 29, 20000);
    empArr[2] = new Employee(5, "George", 35, 5000);
    empArr[3] = new Employee(1, "Terry", 32, 50000);

    // Sort employee array using Comparable interface implementation
    Arrays.sort(empArr);
    System.out.println("Sort Employee list with default Comparable interface:\n" + Arrays.toString(empArr));

    // Sort employee with custom comparator based on age
    Arrays.sort(empArr, Employee.AgeComparator);
    System.out.println("Sort Employee list with custom comparator interface:\n" + Arrays.toString(empArr));

    // Sort employee with custom comparator based on salary
    Arrays.sort(empArr, new SalaryComparator());
    System.out.println("Sort Employee list with custom comparator interface:\n" + Arrays.toString(empArr));
}
```
See the result. The second array is sorted by age and the third array is based salary.
```sh
Sort Employee list with default Comparable interface:
[[id=1, name=Terry, age=32, salary=50000], [id=5, name=George, age=35, salary=5000], [id=10, name=Johnny, age=25, salary=10000], [id=20, name=Peter, age=29, salary=20000]]
Sort Employee list with custom comparator interface:
[[id=10, name=Johnny, age=25, salary=10000], [id=20, name=Peter, age=29, salary=20000], [id=1, name=Terry, age=32, salary=50000], [id=5, name=George, age=35, salary=5000]]
Sort Employee list with custom comparator interface:
[[id=5, name=George, age=35, salary=5000], [id=10, name=Johnny, age=25, salary=10000], [id=20, name=Peter, age=29, salary=20000], [id=1, name=Terry, age=32, salary=50000]]
```

Comparable vs Comparator
* Comparable interface can be used to provide `single` way of sorting whereas Comparator interface is used to provide `different` ways of sorting.
* For using Comparable, Class needs to implement it whereas for using Comparator we donâ€™t need to make any change in the class.
* Comparable interface is in `java.lang` package whereas Comparator interface is present in `java.util` package.
* We donâ€™t need to make any code changes at client side for using Comparable, `Arrays.sort()` or `Collection.sort()` methods automatically uses the `compareTo()` method of the class. For Comparator, client needs to provide the Comparator class to use in compare() method.

### 2.1 How to remove element in for each loop?
It is wrong to call `List.remove()` method in the loop. `ConcurrentModificationException` will be thrown.
```java
private static void wrongWayToRemoveElement() {
    List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
    fruits.add("Apple");
    fruits.add("Banana");
    fruits.add("Orange");
    fruits.add("Watermelon");
    fruits.add("Kiwi");

    // in for each loop
    for (String fruit : fruits) {
        System.out.println("Processing - " + fruit);

        if ("Orange".equals(fruit)) {
            fruits.remove("Orange");  // java.util.ConcurrentModificationException is thrown
        }
    }

    // in iterator loop
    Iterator<String> iterator = fruits.iterator();

    while (iterator.hasNext()){
        String fruit = iterator.next();
        System.out.println("Processing - " + fruit);

        if("Orange".equals(fruit)) {
            fruits.remove("Orange");  // java.util.ConcurrentModificationException is thrown
        }
    }

    System.out.println("fruits set after iteration = " + fruits);
}
```
Output.
```sh
Processing - Apple
Processing - Banana
Processing - Orange
java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
	at java.util.ArrayList$Itr.checkForComodification(ArrayList.java:901)
	at java.util.ArrayList$Itr.next(ArrayList.java:851)
	at johnny.java.collection.ArrayListExample.wrongWayToRemoveElement(ArrayListExample.java:55)
	at johnny.java.collection.ArrayListExample.main(ArrayListExample.java:20)
```
Instead, call `Iterator.remove()` method.
```java
private static void correctWayToRemoveElement() {
    List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
    fruits.add("Apple");
    fruits.add("Banana");
    fruits.add("Orange");
    fruits.add("Watermelon");
    fruits.add("Kiwi");

    Iterator<String> iterator = fruits.iterator();

    while (iterator.hasNext()){
        String fruit = iterator.next();
        System.out.println("Processing - " + fruit);

        if("Orange".equals(fruit)) {
            iterator.remove();  // iterator.remove not list.remove
        }
    }

    System.out.println("fruits set after iteration = " + fruits);
}
```
Output.
```sh
Processing - Apple
Processing - Banana
Processing - Orange
Processing - Watermelon
Processing - Kiwi
fruits set after iteration = [Apple, Banana, Watermelon, Kiwi]
```
### 2.2 ArrayList VS LinkedList
1) The insert and remove operations give good performance (O(1)) in LinkedList compared to ArrayList(O(n)). Hence if there is a requirement of frequent addition and deletion in application then LinkedList is a best choice.

2) Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1)) but not in LinkedList (O(n)) so If there are less add and remove operations and more search operations requirement, ArrayList would be your best bet.

### 2.3 Stack and Queue
```java
Deque<String> stack = new ArrayDeque<String>();
Deque<String> queue = new ArrayDeque<String>();

stack.push("A");
stack.push("B");
stack.push("C");
stack.push("D");

while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
  System.out.print(stack.pop() + " ");
}

queue.add("A");
queue.add("B");
queue.add("C");
queue.add("D");
while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
  System.out.print(queue.remove() + " ");
}
```
Output
```raw
D C B A A B C D
```
### 2.4 Queue VS Deque
```java
Queue queue = new LinkedList();
Queue queue = new PriorityQueue();
Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<Integer>();
```
### 2.5 Use Deque over Stack?
* Stack is concrete class, inherited from Vector. It has no interface.
* Stack is not implemented with linked list.
* Deque is interface. Deque exposes a set of operations which is all about being able to fetch/add/remove items from the start or end of a collection.

```java
Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<Integer>();
```
### 2.6 ArrayDeque Vs LinkedList
ArrayDeque is new with Java 6. If you need add/remove of the both ends, ArrayDeque is significantly better than a linked list. Random access each element is also O(1) for a cyclic queue.

The only better operation of a linked list is removing the current element during iteration.

## 2. Hash Collision Resolution
* Separate chaining
* Linear Probing (Clustering problem)
* Quadratic Probing (May not find a vacant cell)
