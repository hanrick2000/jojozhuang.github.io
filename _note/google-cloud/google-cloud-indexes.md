## 9. Details
### 9.1 Regions and Zones
A region is a specific geographical location where you can host your resources. Each region has one or more zones; most regions have three or more zones.

Regional resources can be used by any resources in that region, regardless of zone, while zonal resources can only be used by other resources in the same zone.
* Regional resources: static external IP addresses
* Zonal resources: virtual machine instances or zonal persistent disks

### 9.2 Stackdriver
* StackDriver is for monitoring and management for services, containers, applications, and infrastructure.
* StackDriver metrics
* Logs retention: Allows you to retain the logs in Stackdriver Logging for 30 days, and gives you a one-click configuration tool to archive data for a longer period in Cloud Storage, see https://cloud.google.com/logging/.
