Java programs that work on web pages are called `applets`. It is replaced by Adobe Flash later.
Java history: Green Project in Sun by Patrick Naughton and `James Gosling`. Name: Oak -> Java.

Evolution of the Java Language.

Version | Year | New Language Features  | Number of Classes and Interfaces
--------|------|------------------------|-----------------------------------
1.0     | 1996 | The language itself    | 211
1.1     | 1997 | Inner classes          | 477
1.2     | 1998 | The strictfp modifier  | 1,524
1.3     | 2000 | None                   | 1,840
1.4     | 2002 | Assertions             | 2,723
5.0     | 2004 | Generic classes, “for each” loop, varargs, autoboxing, metadata, enumerations, static import | 3,279
6       | 2006 | None                   | 3,793
7       | 2011 | Switch with strings, diamond operator, binary literals, exception handling enhancements | 4,024 8       | 2014 | Lambda expressions, interfaces with default methods, stream and date/time libraries | 4,240

In the early days of Java, the language was interpreted. Nowadays, the Java virtual machine uses a just-in-time compiler. hot spot, hot swap.

## 2. The Java Programming Environment
Download Java Development Kit(JDK) from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.

Fortunately, in 2006, the numbering was simplified. The next version of the Java Standard Edition was called Java SE 6, followed by Java SE 7 and Java SE 8. However, the “internal” version numbers are 1.6.0, 1.7.0, and 1.8.0.

When Oracle makes a minor version change to  x urgent issues, it refers to the change as an update. For example, Java SE `8u31` is the 31st update of Java SE 8, and it has the internal version number `1.8.0_31`. An update does not need to be installed over a prior version—it contains the most current version of the whole JDK. Also, not all updates are released to the public, so don’t panic if update 31 isn’t followed by update 32.

## 3. Fundamental Programming Structures in Java
Hello world of Java application.
```java
public class FirstSample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("We will not use 'Hello, World!'");
    }
}
```
Camel Case: The standard naming convention is that class names are nouns that start with an uppercase letter. If a name consists of multiple words, use an initial uppercase letter in each of the words.

### 3.3 Data Types
Java is a `strongly typed` language.  
#### 3.3.1 Four Integer Types  

Type  | Storage Requirement | Range (Inclusive)
------|---------------------|----------------------
int   | 4 bytes             | –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483, 647 (just over 2 billion)
short | 2 bytes             | –32,768 to 32,767
long  | 8 bytes             | –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
byte  | 1 byte              | –128 to 127

* Note that Java does not have any `unsigned versions` of the int, long, short, or byte types. In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer, which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2^32-1. Use the Integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer. Static methods like `compareUnsigned`, `divideUnsigned` etc have been added to the Integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html.

Starting with Java SE 7, you can write numbers in binary, with a prefix `0b` or `0B`. For example, 0b1001 is 9. Also starting with Java SE 7, you can add underscores to number literals, such as `1_000_000` (or 0b1111_0100_0010_0100_0000) to denote one million. The underscores are for human eyes only. The Java compiler simply removes them.

#### 3.3.2 Floating-Point Types

Type  | Storage Requirement | Range (Inclusive)
------|---------------------|----------------------
float | 4 bytes             | Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6–7 significant decimal digits)
long  | 8 bytes             | Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)

* Numbers of type float have a suffix F or f (for example, 3.14F). `Floating-point numbers without an F suffix (such as 3.14) are always considered to be of type double.` You can optionally supply the D or d suffix (for example, 3.14D).

There are three special floating-point values to denote overflows and errors:
* Positive infinity  // eg. 5/0
* Negative infinity  
* NaN (not a number) // eg. 0/0 or square root of a negative number.

```java
if (x == Double.NaN) // is never true
if (Double.isNaN(x)) // check whether x is "not a number"
```

Floating-point numbers are not suitable for  financial calculations in which roundoff errors cannot be tolerated. For example, the command `System.out.println(2.0 - 1.1)` prints `0.8999999999999999`, not 0.9 as you would expect. Such roundoff errors are caused by the fact that floating-point numbers are represented in the binary number system. There is no precise binary representation of the fraction 1/10, just as there is no accurate representation of the fraction 1/3 in the decimal system. If you need precise numerical computations without roundoff errors, use the `BigDecimal` class, which is introduced later in this chapter.

#### 3.3.3 The char Type
```java
'A' //char
"A" //string
```
Values of type char can be expressed as hexadecimal values that run from `\u0000` to `\uFFFF`.

To learn more about the Unicode, read book [Unicode Explained: Internationalize Documents, Programs, and Web Sites](https://www.amazon.com/Unicode-Explained-Internationalize-Documents-Programs/dp/059610121X/).

### 3.4 Variables
```java
// declare and initialize a variable on the same line.
int vacationDays = 12;
double salary = 65000.0;
// define a constant
public static final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
```
### 3.5 Operators
The usual arithmetic operators +, -, \*, / are used in Java for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

`strictfp` keyword
```java
public static strictfp void main(String[] args)
```
Then all instructions inside the main method will use strict floating-point computations. If you tag a class as strictfp, then all of its methods must use strict floating-point computations.

The methods in the `Math` class use the routines in the computer’s floating point unit for fastest performance. If completely predictable results are more important than performance, use the `StrictMath` class instead.

#### 3.5.3 Casts
```java
double x = 9.997;
int nx = (int) x; // nx = 9;
int nx = (int) Math.round(x); // nx = 10;
```

```java
int m=7;
int n=7;
int a=2*++m; //now a is 16, m is 8
int b=2*n++; //now b is 14, n is 8
```

#### 3.6.6 Code Points and Code Units
```java
String greeting = "Hello";
int n = greeting.length(); // is 5.
int cpCount = greeting.codePointCount(0, greeting.length()); // is 5.
```

StringBuilder, StringBuffer  
Input, Scanner
```java
import java.util.*;

public class InputTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        // get first input
        System.out.print("What is your name? ");
        String name = in.nextLine();

        // get second input
        System.out.print("How old are you? ");
        int age = in.nextInt();

        // display output on console
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + ". Next year, you'll be " + (age + 1));
    }
}
```
`Console.readPassword()` for reading password from concole.
```java
import java.io.Console;

public class PasswordTest {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Console cons = System.console();
        try {
            if (cons != null) {
                String username = cons.readLine("User name: ");
                // prints
                System.out.println("User name: " + username);
                // read password into the char array
                char[] pwd = cons.readPassword("Password: ");
                // prints
                System.out.println("Password is: "+ String.valueOf(pwd));
            }
        } catch(Exception ex) {
             ex.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
Run this program in terminal.
```
Johnny@Johnny-Mac:~$ java PasswordTest
User name: Johnny
User name: Johnny
Password:
Password is: 123
Johnny@Johnny-Mac:~$
```
If you run this program in Eclipse IDE through Run As-> Java Application, `System.console()` always return null. See the discussion on StackOverflow [System.console() returns null from Eclipse but fine with Command Prompt
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8969990/system-console-returns-null-from-eclipse-but-fine-with-command-prompt).
It's bug of Eclipse, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=122429.

#### 3.7.3 File Input and Output
Read
```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(Paths.get("myfile.txt"), "UTF-8");
```
Write
```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter("myfile.txt", "UTF-8");
```
### 3.8 Control Flow
#### 3.8.4 Determinate Loops
Caution: For loop may never end when using floating-point numbers for comparison.
```java
public class DoubleLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        for (double x = 0; x != 1.0; x += 0.1) {
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
```
See the below output that before x gets bigger than 2. `x` jumps from `0.9999999999999999` to `1.0999999999999999`. It never equals to `1.0`.
```sh
0.0
0.1
0.2
0.30000000000000004
0.4
0.5
0.6
0.7
0.7999999999999999
0.8999999999999999
0.9999999999999999
1.0999999999999999
1.2
1.3
1.4000000000000001
1.5000000000000002
1.6000000000000003
1.7000000000000004
1.8000000000000005
1.9000000000000006
2.0000000000000004
```

BigInteger and BigDecimal.

```java
BigInteger c = a.add(b); // c = a + b
BigInteger d = c.multiply(b.add(BigInteger.valueOf(2))); // d = c * (b + 2)
```

Increase the size of an array with `Arrays.copyOf`.
```java
int[] arr = new int[3];
arr = Arrays.copyOf(arr, 2 * arr.length);
```

## 4. Objects and Classes
Procedural vs. OO programming  
### 4.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
OOP
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

The most common relationships between classes are:
* Dependence (“uses–a”)
* Aggregation (“has–a”)
* Inheritance (“is–a”)

### 4.2 Using Predefined Classes
The expression new Date() makes an object of type Date, and its value is a reference to that newly created object. That reference is then stored in the deadline variable.
```java
Date deadline = new Date();
```
### 4.3 Defining Your Own Classes
`Constructor` has following features.
* A constructor has the same name as the class.
* A class can have more than one constructor.
* A constructor can take zero, one, or more parameters.
* A constructor has no return value.
* A constructor is always called with the new operator.

Accessor Method:  
Do not write accessor methods that return references to mutable objects.
```java
class Employee {
    private Date hireDay;
    public Date getHireDay() {
        return hireDay; // Bad
    }
}
```
As a rule of thumb, always use `clone()` whenever you need to return a copy of a mutable field.
```java
class Employee {
    private Date hireDay;
    public Date getHireDay() {
        return (Date) hireDay.clone(); // Ok
    }
}
```

A method of the Employee class is permitted to access the `private` fields of any object of type Employee.
```java
public class PrivateAccess {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Employee johnny = new Employee("Johnny");
        Employee cindy = new Employee("Cindy");

        if (johnny.equals(cindy)) {
            System.out.println("Same employee!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("They are not the same employee!");
        }
    }
}

class Employee {
    private String name;

    public Employee(String name) {
        super();
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public boolean equals(Employee other) {
        return name.equals(other.name); }  // equals method accesses private attribute name of other.

}
```
### 4.5 Method Parameters
The term `call by value` means that the method gets just the value that the caller provides. In contrast, `call by reference` means that the method gets the location of the variable that the caller provides. The Java programming language `always` uses call by value. That means that the method gets a copy of all parameter values.

Here is a summary of what you can and cannot do with method parameters in Java:
* A method cannot modify a parameter of a primitive type (that is, numbers or boolean values).
* A method can change the state of an object parameter.
* A method cannot make an object parameter refer to a new object.

For the third one, see the example below.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Employee a = new Employee("Alice");
    Employee b = new Employee("Bob");
    swap(a, b);
    // now, does a refer to Bob, b to Alice? No.
    System.out.println("After: a=" + a.getName()); //After: a=Alice
    System.out.println("After: b=" + b.getName()); //After: b=Bob
}

public void swap(Employee x, Employee y) {
    // x refers to Alice, y to Bob  
    Employee temp = x;
    x=y;
    y = temp;
    // now x refers to Bob, y to Alice
    System.out.println("End of method: x=" + x.getName());  //End of method: x=Bob
    System.out.println("End of method: x=" + x.getName());  //End of method: y=Alice
}
```
The parameter variables x and y in swap method are swapped. But ultimately, this is a wasted effort. When the method ends, the parameter variables x and y are abandoned. The original variables a and b still refer to the same objects as they did before the method call.

For Integer, it won't work either, even if Integer is object type. Because Integer objects are immutable.
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    int x = 2;
    System.out.println("Before: x=" + x); // Before: x=2
    triple(x);
    System.out.println("After: x=" + x); // After: x=2
}

private static void triple(Integer x) {
    x = 3 * x;
}
```
Class Importation
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.*;
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
```
Static Imports
```java
import static java.lang.System.*;
out.println("Goodbye, World!"); // i.e., System.out
exit(0); // i.e., System.exit
```

## 5. Inheritance
### 5.1 Classes, Superclasses, and Subclasses
Java does not support multiple inheritance.
#### 5.1.9 Abstract Classes
A class with one or more abstract methods must itself be declared abstract.
```java
public abstract class Person {
...
public abstract String getDescription(); }
```

Abstract methods act as placeholders for methods that are implemented in the subclasses. When you extend an abstract class, you have two choices. You can leave some or all of the abstract methods undefined; then you must tag the subclass as `abstract as well`. Or you can define all methods, and the subclass is `no longer` abstract.

* A class can even be declared as abstract though it has no abstract methods.
* Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

Here is a summary of the four access modifiers in Java that control visibility:
* Visible to the class only (private).
* Visible to the world (public).
* Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).
* Visible to the package—the (unfortunate) default. No modifiers are needed.

### 5.2 Object: The Cosmic Superclass
#### 5.2.1 The equals Method
The `equals` method in the `Object` class tests whether one object is considered equal to another. The equals method, as implemented in the Object class, determines whether two object references are identical.
#### 5.2.2 Equality Testing and Inheritance
The Java Language Specification requires that the `equals` method has the following properties:
* It is `reflexive`: For any non-null reference x, x.equals(x) should return true.
* It is `symmetric`: For any references x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and
only if y.equals(x) returns true.
* It is `transitive`: For any references x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and
y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.
* It is` consisten`t: If the objects to which x and y refer haven’t changed, then
repeated calls to x.equals(y) return the same value.
* For any `non-null` reference x, x.equals(null) should return false.

Here is a recipe for writing the perfect equals method:
1. Name the explicit parameter otherObject—later, you will need to cast it to another variable that you should call other.
2. Test whether this happens to be identical to otherObject:
```java
 if (this == otherObject) return true;
```
This statement is just an optimization. In practice, this is a common case. It is much cheaper to check for identity than to compare the  elds.
3. Test whether otherObject is null and return false if it is. This test is required.
```java
if (otherObject == null) return false;
```
4. Compare the classes of this and otherObject. If the semantics of equals can change in subclasses, use the getClass test:
```java
if (getClass() != otherObject.getClass()) return false;
```
If the same semantics holds for all subclasses, you can use an instanceof test:
```java
if (!(otherObject instanceof ClassName)) return false;
```

5. Cast otherObject to a variable of your class type:
```java
ClassName other = (ClassName) otherObject;
```
6. Now compare the fields, as required by your notion of equality. Use == for primitive type fields, Objects.equals for object fields. Return true if all fields match, false otherwise.
```java
return field1 == other.field1
&& Objects.equals(field2, other.field2)
&&...;
```

If you redefine equals in a subclass, include a call to super.equals(other).

Wrong
```java
public class Employee {
    public boolean equals(Employee other) {
    }
}
```
Correct
```java
public class Employee {
    @Override // 1. should be override
    public boolean equals(Object other) { // should use Object as input parameter
    }
}
```
#### 5.2.3 The hashCode Method
A hash code is an integer that is derived from an object. The `String` class uses the following algorithm to compute the hash code:
```java
int hash = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++) {
    hash = 31 * hash + charAt(i);
}
```

```java
String s = "Ok";
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
System.out.println(s.hashCode() + " " + sb.hashCode()); // s=2556, sb=20526976
String t = new String("Ok");
StringBuilder tb = new StringBuilder(t);
System.out.println(t.hashCode() + " " + tb.hashCode()); // t=2556, tb=20527144
```
Note that the strings s and t have the same hash code because, `for strings, the hash codes are derived from their contents`. The string builders sb and tb have different hash codes because no hashCode method has been defined for the StringBuilder class and the default hashCode method in the Object class derives `the hash code from the object’s memory address`.

If you redefine the equals method, you will also need to redefine the hashCode method for objects.
```java
public class Employee {
    public int hashCode() {
        return 7 * Objects.hashCode(name)
               + 11 * Double.hashCode(salary)
               + 13 * Objects.hashCode(hireDay);
    }
}
```
Or much simpler.
```java
public class Employee {
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, salary, hireDay);
    }
}
```
Your definitions of `equals` and `hashCode` must be compatible: If x.equals(y) is true, then x.hashCode() must return the same value as y.hashCode().
#### 5.2.4 The toString Method
`toString` method returns a string representing the value of this object.
```java
public String toString() {
    return getClass().getName() + "[name=" + name
    + ",salary=" + salary
    + ",hireDay=" + hireDay + "]";
}
```
```java
Point p = new Point(10, 20);
System.out.println(p); // java.awt.Point[x=10,y=20], toString() has been overrided

System.out.println(System.out) // java.io.PrintStream@2f6684, toString() hasn't been overrided
```
### 5.3 Generic Array Lists
Initial the capacity. The first 100 calls to add will not involve any costly reallocation.
```java
ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<>();
staff.ensureCapacity(100);

// or
ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<>(100);
```
### 5.4 Object Wrappers and Autoboxing
Boxing: Convert primary type to object type.  
Unboxing: Convert object type to primary type.
### 5.5 Methods with a Variable Number of Parameters
```java
// printf is a “varargs” method
System.out.printf("%d %s", n, "widgets");  

// definition of printf
public class PrintStream {
    public PrintStream printf(String fmt, Object... args) // variable number of parameters
    {
        return format(fmt, args);
    }
}
```
### 5.6 Enumeration Classes
```java
public enum Size { SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRA_LARGE };
```
### 5.7 Reflection
'getClass', 'getName'
```java
Employee e = new Employee("Harry Hacker");
System.out.println(e.getClass().getName() + " " + e.getName()); // Employee Harry Hacker
```
Use `newInstance` to create a new instance of the same class type as object.
```java
object.getClass().newInstance();
```
Create a new instance with the given class name.
```java
String s = "java.util.Random";
Object m = Class.forName(s).newInstance();
```

Use `setAccessible` to change access permission.
```java
Employee harry = new Employee("Harry Hacker", 35000, 10, 1, 1989);
Class cl = harry.getClass();
// the class object representing Employee
Field f = cl.getDeclaredField("name");
// the name field of the Employee class, it is private.
f.setAccessible(true);
// now OK to call f.get(harry);
Object v = f.get(harry);
// the value of the name field of the harry object, i.e., the String object "Harry Hacker"
```
#### 5.7.6 Invoking Arbitrary Methods
```java
Employee harry = new Employee("Harry Hacker", 35000, 10, 1, 1989);
Method m1 = Employee.class.getMethod("getName");
String n = (String) m1.invoke(harry);
```

## 6. Interfaces, Lambda Expressions, and Inner Classes
### 6.1 The `Comparable` interface.
Use Integer.compare or Double.compare to compare two variables to avoid overflowing.
```java
public int compareTo(Employee other) {
    return Double.compare(salary, other.salary);
}
```
The documentation of the Comparable interface suggests that the compareTo method should be compatible with the equals method. `That is, x.compareTo(y) should be zero exactly when x.equals(y).` Most classes in the Java API that implement Comparable follow this advice. A notable exception is BigDecimal. `Consider x = new BigDecimal("1.0") and y = new BigDecimal("1.00"). Then x.equals(y) is false because the numbers differ in precision.` But x.compareTo(y) is zero. Ideally, it shouldn’t be, but there was no obvious way of deciding which one should come first.

#### 6.1.5 Default Methods
You can supply a default implementation for any interface method. You must tag such a method with the `default` modifier.  
Default Methods In Interface: Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods. The implementation of these methods has to be provided in a separate class. So, if a new method is to be added in an interface then its implementation code has to be provided in the class implementing the same interface. To overcome this issue, Java 8 has introduced the concept of default methods which allow the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface. See https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/default-methods-java/.
```java
// A simple program to Test Interface default
// methods in java
interface TestInterface
{
    // abstract method
    public void square(int a);

    // default method
    default void show()
    {
        System.out.println("Default Method Executed");
    }
}

class TestClass implements TestInterface
{
    // implementation of square abstract method
    public void square(int a)
    {
        System.out.println(a*a);
    }

    // method show() is not mandatory to be implemented.
}
```
### 6.2 Examples of Interfaces
#### 6.2.2 The Comparator Interface
```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
    int compare(T first, T second);
}
```
#### 6.2.3 Object Cloning
The Cloneable interface
```java
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException  
```
### 6.3 Lambda Expressions
#### 6.3.1 Why Lambdas?
Sort strings by length.
```java
Arrays.sort(words, (first, second) -> first.length() - second.length());
```
#### 6.3.4 Method References
```java
Timer t = new Timer(1000, event -> System.out.println(event));
Timer t = new Timer(1000, System.out::println);
```
The `::` operator separates the method name from the name of an object or class. There are three principal cases:
* object::instanceMethod
* Class::staticMethod
* Class::instanceMethod

#### 6.3.5 Constructor References
`Class::new`
```java
ArrayList<String> names = . . .;
Stream<Person> stream = names.stream().map(Person::new); // Person::new is a reference to a Person constructor.
List<Person> people = stream.collect(Collectors.toList());
```
#### 6.3.8 More about Comparators
The `Comparator` interface has a number of convenient static methods for creating comparators. These methods are intended to be used with lambda expressions or method references.
```java
Arrays.sort(people, Comparator.comparing(Person::getName)); // no need to implement a Comparator by hand
Arrays.sort(people, Comparator.comparing(Person::getLastName).thenComparing(Person::getFirstName)); // chain comparators with the thenComparing method
```
### 6.4 Inner Classes
An `inner class` is a class that is defined inside another class.
* Inner class methods can access the data from the scope in which they are defined—including the data that would otherwise be private.
* Inner classes can be hidden from other classes in the same package.
* Anonymous inner classes are handy when you want to define callbacks without writing a lot of code.

### 6.5 Proxies
You can use a `proxy` to create, at runtime, new classes that implement a given set of interfaces. Proxies are only necessary when you don’t yet know at compile time which interfaces you need to implement.
#### 6.5.1 When to Use Proxies
An `invocation handler` is an object of any class that implements the `InvocationHandler` interface. That interface has a single method:
```java
Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args)
```

Sample
https://dzone.com/articles/java-dynamic-proxy
```java
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler;
import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;

public class JdkProxyDemo {
    interface If {
        void originalMethod(String s);
    }
    static class Original implements If {
        public void originalMethod(String s) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
    static class Handler implements InvocationHandler {
        private final If original;
        public Handler(If original) {
            this.original = original;
        }
        public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args)
                throws IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException,
                InvocationTargetException {
            System.out.println("BEFORE");
            method.invoke(original, args);
            System.out.println("AFTER");
            return null;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Original original = new Original();
        Handler handler = new Handler(original);
        If f = (If) Proxy.newProxyInstance(If.class.getClassLoader(),
                new Class[] { If.class },
                handler);
        f.originalMethod("Hello");
        f.originalMethod("SecondCall");
    }
}
```
Output
```sh
BEFORE
Hello
AFTER
BEFORE
SecondCall
AFTER
```

## 7. Exceptions, Assertions, and Logging In this chapter
### 7.1 Dealing with Errors
#### 7.1.1 The Classification of Exceptions
In the Java programming language, an exception object is always an instance of a class derived from `Throwable`. All exceptions descend from Throwable, but the hierarchy immediately splits into two branches: `Error` and `Exception`.
### 7.2 Catching Exceptions
#### 7.2.2 Catching Multiple Exceptions
As a general rule, you should catch those exceptions that you know how to handle and propagate those that you do not know how to handle.
```java
try {
    //code that might throw exceptions
}
catch (FileNotFoundException | UnknownHostException e) {
    //emergency action for missing files and unknown hosts
}
catch (IOException e) {
    //emergency action for all other I/O problems
}
```
#### 7.2.4 The finally Clause
Decouple try/catch and try/finally blocks.
```java
InputStream in = . . .;
try
{
    try {
        //code that might throw exceptions
    }
    finally {
        in.close();
    }
}
catch (IOException e) {
    //show error message
}
```
The inner try block has a single responsibility: to make sure that the input stream is closed. The outer try block has a single responsibility: to ensure that errors are reported. Not only is this solution clearer, it is also more functional: Errors in the finally clause are reported.

Caution: A finally clause can yield unexpected results when it contains return statements.
```java

public class Finally {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int res = foo(2);
        System.out.println("res=" + res);    // res = 0
        int res2 = foo2(2);
        System.out.println("res2=" + res2);  // res2 = 4
        int res3 = foo3(2);
        System.out.println("res3=" + res3);  // res3 = 4
        int res4 = foo4(2);
        System.out.println("res4=" + res4);  // res3 = 4
    }

    public static int foo(int n) {
        try {
            int res = n * n;
            return res;
        }
        finally {
            return 0; // override the value in try block.
        }
    }

    public static int foo2(int n) {
        int res = 1;
        try {
            res = n * n;
        }
        finally {
            return res;
        }
    }

    public static int foo3(int n) {
        int res = 1;
        try
        {
            try {
                res = n * n;
                res = n / 0;
                return res;
            }
            finally {
                return res; // if return statement exists in finally, exception will be hidden.
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            //show error message
            System.out.println("exception occurs in foo3:" + e);  // no exception caught because of return in finally block.
        }
        return res;
    }

    public static int foo4(int n) {
        int res = 1;
        try
        {
            try {
                res = n * n;
                res = n / 0;
                return res;
            }
            finally {
                //return res; // if return statement exists in finally, exception will be hidden.
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            //show error message
            System.out.println("exception occurs in foo4:" + e);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
The output:
```sh
res=0
res2=4
res3=4
exception occurs in foo4:java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
res4=4
```
#### 7.2.5 The Try-with-Resources Statement
When the try block exits, then res.close() is called automatically. Here is a typical example—reading all words of a file:
```
try (Scanner in = new Scanner(new FileInputStream("/usr/share/dict/words")), "UTF-8")
{
    while (in.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(in.next());
    }
}
```
#### 7.2.6 Analyzing Stack Trace Elements
`Throwable.getStackTrace`, `Thread.getAllStackTraces`, `StackTraceElement`.
```java
Map<Thread, StackTraceElement[]> map = Thread.getAllStackTraces();
for (Thread t : map.keySet())
{
    StackTraceElement[] frames = map.get(t);
    //analyze frames
}
```
### 7.4 Using Assertions
Has better performance and throwing exceptions.
```java
assert x >= 0;
double y = Math.sqrt(x);
```
Enable/Disable assertion
```sh
java -enableassertions MyApp  // enable MyApp
java -ea:MyClass -ea:com.mycompany.mylib... MyApp // enable MyClass, and classes in package com.mycompany.mylib
java -ea:... -da:MyClass MyApp // disable MyClass
```

The Java language gives you three mechanisms to deal with system failures:
* Throwing an exception
* Logging
* Using assertions

When should you choose assertions? Keep these points in mind:
* Assertion failures are intended to be fatal, unrecoverable errors.
* Assertion checks are turned on only during development and testing.
Assertions should only be used to locate internal program errors during testing.

### 7.5 Logging
### 7.6 Debugging Tips
```java
Thread.dumpStack();
```
## 8. Generic Programming
### 8.1 Why Generic Programming?
`Generic programming` means writing code that can be reused for objects of many different types.
### 8.4 Bounds for Type Variables
Restrict `T` to a class that implements the `Comparable` interface—a standard interface with a single method, `compareTo`.
The notation of giving a bound for the type variable T:
```java
<T extends BoundingType>
```
Sample.
```java
public static <T extends Comparable> T min(T[] a) . . .
```
### 8.5 Generic Code and the Virtual Machine
The raw type replaces type variables with the first bound, or Object if no bounds are given.
```java
public class Interval<T extends Comparable & Serializable> implements Serializable
{
    private T lower;
    private T upper;
    ...
    public Interval(T first, T second)
    {
        if (first.compareTo(second) <= 0) { lower = first; upper = second; }
        else { lower = second; upper = first; }
    }
}
```
The raw type Interval looks like this:
```java
public class Interval implements Serializable
{
    private Comparable lower;
    private Comparable upper;
    ...
    public Interval(Comparable first, Comparable second) { . . . }
}
```
In summary, you need to remember these facts about translation of Java generics:
* There are no generics in the virtual machine, only ordinary classes and methods.
* All type parameters are replaced by their bounds.
* Bridge methods are synthesized to preserve polymorphism.
* Casts are inserted as necessary to preserve type safety.

### 8.6 Restrictions and Limitations
Type parameters cannot be instantiated with primitive types. There is no Pair\<double\>, only Pair\<Double\>. The reason is, of course, `type erasure`. After erasure, the Pair class has fields of type `Object`, and you can’t use them to store double values.
```java
if (a instanceof Pair<String>) // Error, Runtime Type Inquiry Only Works with Raw Types
Pair<String>[] table = new Pair<String>[10]; // Error. cannot Create Arrays of Parameterized Types
public Pair() { first = new T(); second = new T(); } // Error, Cannot Instantiate Type Variables
public static <T extends Comparable> T[] minmax(T[] a) { T[] mm = new T[2]; . . . } // Error, Cannot Construct a Generic Array
```
### 8.7 Inheritance Rules for Generic Types
### 8.8 Wildcard Types
```java
Pair<? extends Employee>
```
Unbounded Wildcards
```java
public static boolean hasNulls(Pair<?> p)
{
    return p.getFirst() == null || p.getSecond() == null;
}
```
Using Class<T> Parameters for Type Matching
```java
public static <T> Pair<T> makePair(Class<T> c) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException
{
    return new Pair<>(c.newInstance(), c.newInstance());
}
```
### 8.9 Reflection and Generics

## 9. Collections
### 9.1 The Java Collections Framework
#### 9.1.2 TheCollectionInterface
```java
public interface Collection<E> {
    boolean add(E element);
    Iterator<E> iterator();
    ...
}
```
#### 9.1.3 Iterators
```java
public interface Iterator<E> {
    E next();
    boolean hasNext();
    void remove();
    default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action);
}
```
The `for each` loop works with any object that implements the `Iterable` interface, an interface with a single abstract method:
```java
public interface Iterable<T> {
    Iterator<T> iterator();
    ...
}
```
* The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface.
* A List is an ordered collection.

### 9.2 Concrete Collections
#### 9.2.1 Linked Lists
Add item to Linked List. The add method adds the new element before the iterator position.
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    List<String> staff = new LinkedList<>();
    staff.add("Amy");
    staff.add("Bob");
    staff.add("Carl");
    ListIterator<String> iter = staff.listIterator();
    iter.next(); // skip past first element
    iter.add("Juliet");
    iter.add("John");

    for(String item: staff) {
        System.out.println(item);
    }
}
```
If you call the add method multiple times, the elements are simply added in the order in which you supplied them. They are all added in turn before the current iterator position(eg. 'Bob').
```sh
Amy
Juliet
John
Bob
Carl
```
`ConcurrentModificationException` exception may occur.

The only reason to use a linked list is to minimize the cost of insertion and removal in the middle of the list. If you have only a few elements, you can just use an ArrayList. If you want random access into a collection, use an array or ArrayList, not a linked list.
#### 9.2.2 Array Lists
We recommend that you use an `ArrayList` instead of a `Vector` whenever you don’t need synchronization.
#### 9.2.3 Hash Sets
In Java, hash tables are implemented as arrays of linked lists. Key concepts: hash collision, rehash, load factor at 0.75.
![image](/public/images/note/core-java-volume-i-fundamentals-10th-edition/hashtable.png){:width="800px"}  
* [Diagrams on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JQm4fmR0wIOm11OqS4H4qyhb_z96WnDzaLI0u28CYWc/edit#slide=id.g35eabee3aa_0_0?usp=sharing)

#### 9.2.4 Tree Sets
A tree set is a sorted collection. It is implemented by red-black tree.
```java
SortedSet<String> sorter = new TreeSet<>(); // TreeSet implements SortedSet
sorter.add("Bob");
sorter.add("Amy");
sorter.add("Carl");
for (String s : sorter) System.println(s); // output: Amy Bob Carl.
```
#### 9.2.6 Priority Queues
Implemented by heap. The iteration does not visit the elements in sorted order. However, removal always yields the smallest remaining element.
```java
PriorityQueue<LocalDate> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
pq.add(LocalDate.of(1906, 12, 9)); // G. Hopper
pq.add(LocalDate.of(1815, 12, 10)); // A. Lovelace
pq.add(LocalDate.of(1903, 12, 3)); // J. von Neumann
pq.add(LocalDate.of(1910, 6, 22)); // K. Zuse
System.out.println("Iterating over elements...");
for (LocalDate date : pq) {
    System.out.println(date); // not in order
}
System.out.println("Removing elements...");
while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println(pq.remove()); // in order
}
```
output
```sh
Iterating over elements...
1815-12-10
1906-12-09
1903-12-03
1910-06-22
Removing elements...
1815-12-10
1903-12-03
1906-12-09
1910-06-22
```
### 9.3 Maps
HashMap, TreeMap
#### 9.3.1 Basic Map Operations
```java
// construct hashmap
Map<String, Employee> staff = new HashMap<>(); // HashMap implements Map
Employee harry = new Employee("Harry Hacker");
staff.put("987-98-9996", harry);
// get value by key
String id = "987-98-9996";
Employee emp = staff.get(id); // gets harry
```
#### 9.3.2 Updating Map Entries
`getOrDefault` method.
```java
HashMap<Integer, String> mapStudent = new HashMap<>();
// put contents to our HashMap
mapStudent.put(12001, "Eric");
mapStudent.put(12002, "Johnny");

String name = mapStudent.getOrDefault(12003, "DefaultName");
System.out.println(name);

mapStudent.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.println("key=" + k + ", value=" + v));
```
Update. getOrDefault and putIfAbsent.
```java
counts.put(word, counts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
//or
counts.putIfAbsent(word, 0);
counts.put(word, counts.get(word) + 1); // Now we know that get will succeed
/or
counts.merge(word, 1, Integer::sum);
```
#### 9.3.3 Map Views
* Set<K> keySet()
* Collection<V> values()
* Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet()

```java
// iterate keys
Set<String> keys = map.keySet();
for (String key : keys)
{
    //do something with key
}

// iterate pairs
for (Map.Entry<String, Employee> entry : staff.entrySet()) {
    String k = entry.getKey();
    Employee v = entry.getValue();
    //do something with k, v
}

//or
counts.forEach((k, v) -> {
    //do something with k, v
});
```
#### 9.3.4 Weak Hash Maps
The `WeakHashMap` class was designed to solve an interesting problem. What happens with a value whose key is no longer used anywhere in your program? Suppose the last reference to a key has gone away. Then, there is no longer any way to refer to the value object. But, as no part of the program has the key any more, the key/value pair cannot be removed from the map. Why can’t the garbage collector remove it? Isn’t it the job of the garbage collector to remove unused objects?  
Unfortunately, it isn’t quite so simple. The garbage collector traces live objects. As long as the map object is live, all buckets in it are live and won’t be reclaimed. Thus, your program should take care to remove unused values from long-lived maps. Or, you can use a WeakHashMap instead. This data structure cooperates with the garbage collector to remove key/value pairs when the only reference to the key is the one from the hash table entry.  
Here are the inner workings of this mechanism. The WeakHashMap uses `weak references` to hold keys. A `WeakReference` object holds a reference to another object—in our case, a hash table key. Objects of this type are treated in a special way by the garbage collector. Normally, if the garbage collector finds that a particular object has no references to it, it simply reclaims the object. However, if the object is reachable only by a WeakReference, the garbage collector still reclaims the object, but places the weak reference that led to it into a queue. The operations of the WeakHashMap periodically check that queue for newly arrived weak references. The arrival of a weak reference in the queue signifies that the key was no longer used by anyone and has been collected. The WeakHashMap then removes the associated entry. See more [here](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2001/07/09/optimization.html?page=2).  

HashMap                      | WeakHashMap
-----------------------------|-------------------
Map h = new HashMap(); <br />     Object key = new Object;<br />   h.put(key, "xyz");<br />         key = null; | Map h = new WeakHashMap(); <br /> Object key = new Object; <br /> h.put(key, "xyz");<br /> key = null; <br /> //Conceptually, this is similar to inserting a line before the put() call like this: <br /> key = new WeakReferenkey(key); <br />
The key is referenced directly by the HashMap. | The key is not referenced directly by the WeakHashMap. Instead, a WeakReference object is referenced directly by the WeakHashMap, and the key is referenced weakly from the WeakReference object.
The value is referenced directly by the HashMap. | The value is referenced directly by the HashMap.
The key is not garbage collectable, since the map contains a strong reference to the key. The key could be obtained by iterating over the keys of the HashMap. | The key is garbage collectable, as nothing else in the application refers to it, and the WeakReference only holds the key weakly. Iterating over the keys of the WeakHashMap might obtain the key, but might not, if the key has been garbage collected.
The value is similarly not garbage collectable. | The value is not directly garbage collectable. However, when the key is collected by the garbage collector, the WeakReference object is subsequently removed from the WeakHashMap as a key, thus making the value garbage collectable too.

WeakHashMap Sample:  
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
        testHashMap();
        testWeakHashMap();
    }
    catch (InterruptedException iex) {
        System.out.println(iex);
    }
}

private static void testHashMap() throws InterruptedException {
    Map<Object, String> hm = new HashMap<Object, String>();

    Object key = new Object();
    hm.put(key, "xyz");
    System.out.println(hm.size());  // 1
    key = null;
    System.gc();
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    System.out.println(hm.size());  // 1
}

private static void testWeakHashMap() throws InterruptedException {
    Map<Object, String> whm = new WeakHashMap<Object, String>();

    Object key = new Object();
    whm.put(key, "xyz");

    System.out.println(whm.size()); // 1
    key = null;
    System.gc();
    Thread.sleep(2000);
    System.out.println(whm.size()); // 0, the only item has been garbage collected
}
```
#### 9.3.5 Linked Hash Sets and Maps
Insertion Order, Access Order.  
Syntax:
```java
LinkedHashMap<K, V>(initialCapacity, loadFactor, true)
```
Samples:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    testInsertionOrder();
    testAccessOrder();

```
#### 9.3.6 Enumeration Sets and Maps
```java
import java.util.EnumSet;

public class EnumerationSetAndMapDemo {
    enum Weekday { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY };
    static EnumSet<Weekday> always = EnumSet.allOf(Weekday.class);
    static EnumSet<Weekday> never = EnumSet.noneOf(Weekday.class);
    static EnumSet<Weekday> workday = EnumSet.range(Weekday.MONDAY, Weekday.FRIDAY);
    static EnumSet<Weekday> mwf = EnumSet.of(Weekday.MONDAY, Weekday.WEDNESDAY, Weekday.FRIDAY);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(java.util.Arrays.asList(Weekday.values())); // [MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY]
        System.out.println(always);  // [MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY]
        System.out.println(never);   // []
        System.out.println(workday); // [MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY]
        System.out.println(mwf);     // [MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY]
    }
}
```
#### 9.3.7 Identity Hash Maps
The hash values for the keys should not be computed by the `hashCode` method but by the `System.identityHashCode` method. That’s the method that Object.hashCode uses to compute a hash code from the object’s memory address. Also, for comparison of objects, the IdentityHashMap uses `==`, not `equals`.
```java
// HashMap
Map hm = new HashMap();
hm.put("hmkey","hmvalue");
hm.put(new String("hmkey"),"hmvalue1"); // same key but different value

// prints 1 since it compares the objects logically and both the keys are same
System.out.println("Size of HashMap--"+hm.size()); // 1

// IdentityHashMap
Map ihm = new IdentityHashMap();
ihm.put("ihmkey","ihmvalue");
ihm.put(new String("ihmkey"),"ihmvalue1"); // same key but different value

//ihm.size() will print 2 since it compares the objects by reference
System.out.println("Size of IdentityHashMap--"+ihm.size());  // 2
```
It is faster and uses less memory than HashMap or TreeMap.
### 9.4 Views and Wrappers
#### 9.4.1 Lightweight Collection Wrappers
The returned object by `Arrays.asList` is not an ArrayList.  
All methods that would change the size of the array (such as the add and remove methods of the associated iterator) throw an UnsupportedOperationException.
```java
Card[] cardDeck = new Card[52];
List<Card> cardList = Arrays.asList(cardDeck); // The returned object is not an ArrayList.
cardList.add(new Card(1, 3));  // java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown
```
The following call creates a List containing 100 strings, all set to "DEFAULT":
```java
List<String> settings = Collections.nCopies(100, "DEFAULT");
```
Use `Collections.singleton()` to get an immutable single-element.
```java
String[] numbers = {"1", "2", "4", "2", "1", "2", "3", "1", "3", "4", "3", "3"};

/* Creating list and removing its elements */
List numList = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(numbers));
System.out.println("Original: " + numList);
numList.remove("1");
System.out.println("numList after removal of 1 " + numList);
numList.remove("1");
System.out.println("numList after removal of 1  " + numList);
numList.remove("2");
System.out.println("numList after removal of 2 " + numList);

/* Creating another list and removing its elements using singleton() method */
List numList2 = new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(numbers));
System.out.println("Original: " + numList2);

// Selectively delete "1" from all it's occurrences
numList2.removeAll(Collections.singleton("1"));
System.out.println("numList2 after removal of 1 with singleton:" + numList2);

// Selectively delete "4" from all it's occurrences
numList2.removeAll(Collections.singleton("4"));
System.out.println("numList2 after removal of 4 with singleton:" + numList2);

// Selectively delete "3" from all it's occurrences
numList2.removeAll(Collections.singleton("3"));
System.out.println("numList2 after removal of 3 with singleton: " + numList2);
```
Output:
```sh
Original: [1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3]
numList after removal of 1 [2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3]
numList after removal of 1  [2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3]
numList after removal of 2 [4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3]
Original: [1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 3]
numList2 after removal of 1 with singleton:[2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3]
numList2 after removal of 4 with singleton:[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]
numList2 after removal of 3 with singleton: [2, 2, 2]
```
#### 9.4.2 Subranges
The first index is inclusive, the second exclusive—just like the parameters for the substring operation of the String class.
```java
// list
List group2 = staff.subList(10, 20);
// set
SortedSet<E> subSet(E from, E to)
SortedSet<E> headSet(E to)
SortedSet<E> tailSet(E from)
// map
SortedMap<K, V> subMap(K from, K to)
SortedMap<K, V> headMap(K to)
SortedMap<K, V> tailMap(K from)
// NavigableSet
NavigableSet<E> subSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive, E to, boolean toInclusive)
NavigableSet<E> headSet(E to, boolean toInclusive)
NavigableSet<E> tailSet(E from, boolean fromInclusive)
```
#### 9.4.3 Unmodi able Views
```java
Collections.unmodifiableCollection
Collections.unmodifiableList
Collections.unmodifiableSet
Collections.unmodifiableSortedSet
Collections.unmodifiableNavigableSet
Collections.unmodifiableMap
Collections.unmodifiableSortedMap
Collections.unmodifiableNavigableMap
```
Create a untouchable list.
```java
List<Card> cardList = new LinkedList<>();
List<Card> unml = Collections.unmodifiableList(cardList);
```
#### 9.4.4 Synchronized Views
```java
Map<String, Employee> map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<String, Employee>());
```
#### 9.4.5 Checked Views
Use `Collections.checkedList` to create a safe list.
```java
// Example 1
ArrayList<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList rawList = strings; // warning only, not an error, for compatibility with legacy code
rawList.add(new Date()); // now strings contains a Date object!
// Example 2
List myList = new ArrayList();
myList.add("one");
myList.add("two");
myList.add("three");
myList.add("four");
//you can add any type of elements to myList object
myList.add(10);

List chkList = Collections.checkedList(myList, String.class);
System.out.println("Checked list content: "+chkList); // [one, two, three, four, 10]
chkList.add(10); //throws java.lang.ClassCastException: Attempt to insert class java.lang.Integer element into collection with element type class java.lang.String
```
### 9.5 Algorithms
#### 9.5.1 Sorting and Shuffling
```java
Collections.sort(cards);
Collections.shuffle(cards);
```
#### 9.5.2 Binary Search
```java
i = Collections.binarySearch(c, element);
i = Collections.binarySearch(c, element, comparator);
```
#### 9.5.3 Simple Algorithms
```java
Collections.replaceAll("C++", "Java");
words.removeIf(w -> w.length() <= 3);
words.replaceAll(String::toLowerCase);
```
#### 9.5.4 Bulk Operations
```java
coll1.removeAll(coll2); // removes all elements from coll1 that are present in coll2
coll1.retainAll(coll2); // removes all elements from coll1 that are not present in coll2
```
Find the intersection of two sets—the elements that two sets have in common.
```java
String[] nameA = new String[] {"Peter","Mike","Johnny","Cindy"};
String[] nameB = new String[] {"Mike","Eric","Cindy","Allan","Talor"};
List<String> listA = Arrays.asList(nameA);
List<String> listB = Arrays.asList(nameB);
Set<String> result = new HashSet<>(listA);
result.retainAll(listB);
System.out.println(result); // [Mike, Cindy]
````
#### 9.5.5 Converting between Collections and Arrays
```java
// convert array to hashset
String[] values = new String[10];
HashSet<String> staff = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(values));

// Convert list to array
List<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<Employee>();
Object[] values = staff.toArray();  // the type can only be Object.
String[] values = (String[]) staff.toArray(); // Error!

// Convert list to typed array
String[] values = staff.toArray(new String[0]);
// or
String[] values = staff.toArray(new String[staff.size()]);
````
#### 9.5.6 Writing Your Own Algorithms
If you write your own algorithm (or, in fact, any method that has a collection as a parameter), you should work with interfaces, not concrete implementations, whenever possible.
```java
// using concrete class, bad
void fillMenu(JMenu menu, ArrayList<JMenuItem> items) {
    for (JMenuItem item : items) {
        menu.add(item);
    }
}
// using interface, good
void fillMenu(JMenu menu, Collection<JMenuItem> items) {
    for (JMenuItem item : items) {
        menu.add(item);
    }
}
```
### 9.6 Legacy Collections  
Legacy classes in the collections framework
![image](/public/images/note/core-java-volume-i-fundamentals-10th-edition/legacycollections.png){:width="800px"}  
#### 9.6.1 The Hashtable Class  
Hashtable, HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap. See more about [What's the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/510632/whats-the-difference-between-concurrenthashmap-and-collections-synchronizedmap)

  Property         | HashMap        | Hashtable            | ConcurrentHashMap |  
-------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|--
 Null  values/keys | allowed        | not allowed          | not allowed       |  
 Is thread-safe    | no             | yes                  | yes               |  
 Lock mechanism    | not applicable | locks the whole map  | locks the portion |  
 Iterator          | fail-fast      | fail-fast            | weakly consistent |  

#### 9.6.2 Enumerations
Interface.
```java
public interface Enumeration<E> {
    boolean hasMoreElements();
    E nextElement();
}
```
Example.
```java
Enumeration<Employee> e = staff.elements();
while (e.hasMoreElements())
{
    Employee e = e.nextElement();
    ...
}
```
#### 9.6.3 Property Maps
A `property map` is a map structure of a very special type. It has three particular characteristics:
* The keys and values are strings.
* The table can be saved to a file and loaded from a file.
* A secondary table for defaults is used.

#### 9.6.4 Stacks
push, pop, peek, empty.
#### 9.6.5 Bit Sets
```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
    BitSet bits1 = new BitSet(16);
    BitSet bits2 = new BitSet(16);

    // set some bits
    for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        if((i % 2) == 0) bits1.set(i);
        if((i % 5) != 0) bits2.set(i);
    }

    System.out.println("Initial pattern in bits1: ");
    System.out.println(toBinaryString(bits1) + "," + bits1);
    System.out.println("Initial pattern in bits2: ");
    System.out.println(toBinaryString(bits2) + "," + bits2);

    // AND bits
    bits2.and(bits1);
    System.out.println("bits2 AND bits1: ");
    System.out.println(toBinaryString(bits2) + "," + bits2);

    // OR bits
    bits2.or(bits1);
    System.out.println("bits2 OR bits1: ");
    System.out.println(toBinaryString(bits2) + "," + bits2);

    // XOR bits
    bits2.xor(bits1);
    System.out.println("bits2 XOR bits1: ");
    System.out.println(toBinaryString(bits2) + "," + bits2);
}

private static String toBinaryString(BitSet bi) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for( int i = 0; i <= bi.length();  i++ )
    {
        sb.append(bi.get(i) == true ? 1: 0 );
    }

    return sb.reverse().toString();
}
```
Output
```sh
Initial pattern in bits1:
0101010101010101,{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}
Initial pattern in bits2:
0111101111011110,{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14}
bits2 AND bits1:
0101000101010100,{2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14}
bits2 OR bits1:
0101010101010101,{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}
bits2 XOR bits1:
0,{}

### 13.1 JAR Files
A Java Archive(JAR) file can contain both class files and other file types such as image and sound files. Moreover, JAR files are compressed, using the familiar ZIP compression format.
#### 13.1.1 Creating JAR files
```sh
// syntax
jar options File1 File2 . . .
// Example
jar cvf CalculatorClasses.jar *.class icon.gif
```
The options are similar to the options of the UNIX `tar` command.
#### 13.1.2 The Manifest
MANIFEST.MF, META-INF subdirectory, main section  
Make a new JAR file with a manifest.
```sh
jar cfm MyArchive.jar manifest.mf com/mycompany/mypkg/*.class
```
#### 13.1.3 Executable JAR Files
Create an executable JAR file. Need to add `e` option and specify the entry point main class.
```sh
jar cvfe MyProgram.jar com.mycompany.mypkg.MainAppClass com/mycompany/mypkg/*.class
```
Or, use manifest file.
```sh
Main-Class: com.mycompany.mypkg.MainAppClass
```
Start the program.
```sh
java -jar MyProgram.jar
```
#### 13.1.4 Resources  
getResource,
```java
// Get image
URL url = ResourceTest.class.getResource("about.gif");
Image img = new ImageIcon(url).getImage();

// Get file content
InputStream stream = ResourceTest.class.getResourceAsStream("about.txt");
Scanner in = new Scanner(stream, "UTF-8");
```
Pacakge.
```sh
jar cvfm ResourceTest.jar resource/ResourceTest.mf resource/*.class resource/*.gif resource/*.txt
```
#### 13.1.5 Sealing
```manifest
Name: com/mycompany/util/
Sealed: true
```
then, package.
```sh
jar cvfm MyArchive.jar manifest.mf *.class
```
### 13.2 Storage of Application Preferences
#### 13.2.1 Property Maps
A `property map` is a data structure that stores key/value pairs. Property maps are often used for storing configuration information. Property maps have three particular characteristics:
* The keys and values are strings.
* The map can easily be saved to a file and loaded from a file.
* There is a secondary table for default values.
The Java class that implements a property map is called `Properties`.
```java
// Create properties
Properties settings = new Properties();
settings.setProperty("width", "200");
settings.setProperty("title", "Hello, World!");

// Write to file, storing
OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("program.properties");
settings.store(out, "Program Properties");

// File content
#Program Properties
#Mon Apr 30 07:22:52 2007
width=200
title=Hello, World!
```
Load the properties from a file.
```java
// Loading
InputStream in = new FileInputStream("program.properties");
settings.load(in);

// Get with default value in case property doesn't exist.
String title = settings.getProperty("title", "Default title");
```
#### 13.2.2 The Preferences API
```java
// user root
Preferences root = Preferences.userRoot();
// system root
Preferences root = Preferences.systemRoot();

// by path
Preferences node = root.node("/com/mycompany/myapp");
// use class name as path
Preferences node = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(obj.getClass());
Preferences node = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(obj.getClass());
```
Sample preference file.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE preferences SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/preferences.dtd">
<preferences EXTERNAL_XML_VERSION="1.0">
   <root type="user">
      <map />
      <node name="com">
         <map />
         <node name="horstmann">
            <map />
            <node name="corejava">
               <map>
                  <entry key="left" value="11" />
                  <entry key="top" value="9" />
                  <entry key="width" value="453" />
                  <entry key="height" value="365" />
                  <entry key="title" value="Hello, World!" />
               </map>
            </node>
         </node>
      </node>
   </root>
</preferences>
```
### 13.3 Service Loaders
The ServiceLoader class makes it easy to load plug-ins that conform to a common interface.
## 14. Concurrency
### 14.1 What Are Threads?
Runnable interface
```java
public interface Runnable {
    void run();
}

// lambda expression:
Runnable r = () -> { task code };

// construct a thread object
Thread t = new Thread(r);
t.start();
```
Thread class.
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        //task code
    }
}
```
### 14.2 Interrupting Threads  
```java
Runnable r = () -> {
    try
    {
        //...
        while(!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()&& more work to do)
        {
            //do more work
        }
    }
    catch(InterruptedException e) {
        // thread was interrupted during sleep or wait
        // Thread.currentThread().interrupt()
    }
    finally
    {
        // cleanup, if required
    }
    // exiting the run method terminates the thread
};
```
### 14.3 Thread States
Threads can be in one of six states:
* New
* Runnable
* Blocked
* Waiting
* Timed waiting

![image](/public/images/note/core-java-volume-i-fundamentals-10th-edition/threadstate.png){:width="800px"}  
#### 14.3.2 Runnable Threads
preemptive scheduling, cooperative scheduling  
Always keep in mind that a runnable thread may or may not be running at any given time. (This is why the state is called “runnable” and not “running”.)
#### 14.3.3 Blocked and Waiting Threads
#### 14.3.4 Terminated Threads
A thread is terminated for one of two reasons:
* It dies a natural death because the run method exits normally.
* It dies abruptly because an uncaught exception terminates the run method.

### 14.4 Thread Properties
#### 14.4.1 Thread Priorities
MIN_PRIORITY (defined as 1 in the Thread class) and MAX_PRIORITY (defined as 10). NORM_PRIORITY is defined as 5.
Thread priorities are `highly system dependent`. When the virtual machine relies on the thread implementation of the host platform, the Java thread priorities are mapped to the priority levels of the host platform, which may have more or fewer thread priority levels. For example, Windows has seven priority levels. Some of the Java priorities will map to the same operating system level. In the Oracle JVM for Linux, thread priorities are ignored altogether—all threads have the same priority.
#### 14.4.2 Daemon Threads  
A daemon is simply a thread that has no other role in life than to serve others. Examples are timer threads that send regular “timer ticks” to other threads or threads that clean up stale cache entries.
```java
t.setDaemon(true);
```
#### 14.4.3 Handlers for Uncaught Exceptions
Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
### 14.5 Synchronization
#### 14.5.3 Lock Objects
synchronized, ReentrantLock
```java
Lock myLock = new ReentrantLock(); // ReentrantLock implements the Lock interface
myLock.lock(); // a ReentrantLock object
try
{
    //critical section
}
finally {
    myLock.unlock(); // make sure the lock is unlocked even if an exception is thrown
}
```
#### 14.5.4 Condition Objects
await, signalAll, or signal
```java
private Condition sufficientFunds = bankLock.newCondition();

public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount)
{
    bankLock.lock();
    try
    {
        while (accounts[from] < amount) {
            sufficientFunds.await();
        }
        // transfer funds
        // ...
        sufficientFunds.signalAll();
    }
    finally {
        bankLock.unlock();
    }
}
```
#### 14.5.5 The synchronized Keyword
```java
public synchronized void method()
{
    //method body
}

// equivalent to
public void method() {
    this.intrinsicLock.lock();
    try
    {
        //method body
    }
    finally
    {
        this.intrinsicLock.unlock();
    }
}
```
```java
intrinsicCondition.await();     // equivalent to wait
intrinsicCondition.signalAll(); // equivalent to notifyAll
```
NOTE: The `wait`, `notifyAll`, and `notify` methods are final methods of the Object class. The Condition methods had to be named `await`, `signalAll`, and `signal` so that they don’t conflict with those methods.
Example.
```java
class Bank {
    private double[] accounts;
    public synchronized void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) throws InterruptedException {
        while (accounts[from] < amount) {
            wait(); // wait on intrinsic object lock's single condition
        }
        accounts[from] -= amount;
        accounts[to] += amount;
        notifyAll(); // notify all threads waiting on the condition
    }
    public synchronized double getTotalBalance() { . . . }
}
```
Each object has an intrinsic lock, and the lock has an intrinsic condition. The lock manages the threads that try to enter a `synchronized` method. The condition manages the threads that have called `wait`.
#### 14.5.6 Synchronized Blocks
```java
public void transfer(int from, int to, int amount) {
    synchronized (lock) // an ad-hoc lock
    {
        accounts[from] -= amount;
        accounts[to] += amount;
    }
}
```
#### 14.5.7 The Monitor Concept
In the terminology of Java, a monitor has these properties:
* A monitor is a class with only private fields.
* Each object of that class has an associated lock.
* All methods are locked by that lock. In other words, if a client calls obj.method(), then the lock for obj is automatically acquired at the beginning of the method call and relinquished when the method returns. Since all fields are private, this arrangement ensures that no thread can access the fields while another thread manipulates them.
* The lock can have any number of associated conditions.

`Every object` in Java has an intrinsic lock and an intrinsic condition. If a method is declared with the `synchronized` keyword, it acts like a monitor method. The condition variable is accessed by calling `wait/notifyAll/notify`.

However, a Java object differs from a monitor in three important ways, compromising thread safety:
* Fields are not required to be private.
* Methods are not required to be synchronized.
* The intrinsic lock is available to clients.

#### 14.5.8 Volatile Fields
```java
private volatile boolean done;
public boolean isDone() { return done; }
public void setDone() { done = true; }
```
Volatile variables do not provide any atomicity. For example, the method is not guaranteed to flip the value of the field.
```java
public void flipDone() { done = !done; } // not atomic
```
#### 14.5.9 Final Variables
`final` guarantees that other threads would see the updated value of accounts. Of course, the operations on the map are not thread safe. If multiple threads mutate and read the map, you still need synchronization.
```java
final Map<String, Double> accounts = new HashMap<>();
```
#### 14.5.10 Atomics
tomicInteger, AtomicIntegerArray, AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater, AtomicLongArray, AtomicLongFieldUpdater, AtomicReference, AtomicReferenceArray, and AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater.
```java
do{
    oldValue = largest.get();
    newValue = Math.max(oldValue, observed);
} while (!largest.compareAndSet(oldValue, newValue));

// java 8
largest.updateAndGet(x -> Math.max(x, observed));
//or
largest.accumulateAndGet(observed, Math::max);
```
LongAdder, LongAccumulator, DoubleAdder, DoubleAccumulator
#### 14.5.11 Deadlocks
#### 14.5.12 Thread-Local Variables
`ThreadLocal`
```java
// construct one instance per thread
public static final ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> dateFormat =
ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd"));
// access the actual formatter
String dateStamp = dateFormat.get().format(new Date());
```
#### 14.5.13 Lock Testing and Timeouts
```java
if (myLock.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
    // now the thread owns the lock
    try{...}
    finally { myLock.unlock(); }
}
else {
    // do something else
}

myCondition.await(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
```
#### 14.5.14 Read/Write Locks
The `java.util.concurrent.locks` package defines two lock classes, the `ReentrantLock` that we already discussed and the `ReentrantReadWriteLock`. The latter is useful when there are many threads that read from a data structure and fewer threads that modify it.
```java
// Construct a ReentrantReadWriteLock object:
private ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
// Extract the read and write locks:
private Lock readLock = rwl.readLock();
private Lock writeLock = rwl.writeLock();
// Use the read lock in all accessors:
public double getTotalBalance() {
    readLock.lock();
    try{...}
    finally { readLock.unlock(); }
}
// Use the write lock in all mutators:
public void transfer(. . .) {
    writeLock.lock();
    try{...}
    finally { writeLock.unlock(); }
}
```
#### 14.5.15 Why the stop and suspend Methods Are Deprecated
`stop`: This method terminates all pending methods, including the run method. When a thread is stopped, it immediately gives up the locks on all objects that it has locked. This can leave objects in an inconsistent state. `Object is damaged.`  
`suspend`: Unlike stop, suspend won’t damage objects. However, if you suspend a thread that owns a lock, then the lock is unavailable until the thread is resumed. If the thread that calls the suspend method tries to acquire the same lock, the program `deadlocks`: The suspended thread waits to be resumed, and the suspending thread waits for the lock.
14.6 Blocking Queues  
Blocking Queue Methods

Method  | Normal Action                        | Action in Special Circumstances
--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
add     | Adds an element                      | Throws an IllegalStateException if the queue is full
element | Returns the head element             | Throws a NoSuchElementException if the queue is empty
offer   | Adds an element and returns true     | Returns false if the queue is full
peek    | Returns the head element             | Returns null if the queue is empty
poll    | Removes and returns the head element | Returns null if the queue is empty
put     | Adds an element                      | Blocks if the queue is full
remove  | Removes and returns the head element | Throws a NoSuchElementException if the queue is empty
take    | Removes and returns the head element | Blocks if the queue is empty

```java
//  tries for 100 milliseconds to insert an element to the tail of the queue. If it succeeds, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false when it times out.
boolean success = q.offer(x, 100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
// tries for 100 milliseconds to remove the head of the queue. If it succeeds, it returns the head; otherwise, it returns null when it times out.
Object head = q.poll(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```
LinkedBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue, DelayQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue.
### 14.7 Thread-Safe Collections
#### 14.7.1 Efficient Maps, Sets, and Queues
ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentSkipListMap, ConcurrentSkipListSet, and ConcurrentLinkedQueue.

The collections return `weakly consistent` iterators. That means that the iterators may or may not reflect all modifications that are made after they were constructed, but they will not return a value twice and they will not throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

The concurrent hash map can efficiently support a large number of readers and a fixed number of writers. By default, it is assumed that there are up to 16 simultaneous writer threads. There can be many more writer threads, but if more than 16 write at the same time, the others are temporarily blocked. You can specify a higher number in the constructor, but it is unlikely that you will need to.

As of Java SE 8, the concurrent hash map organizes the buckets as trees, not lists, when the key type implements Comparable, guaranteeing O(log(n)) performance.

#### 14.7.2 Atomic Update of Map Entries
```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, Long> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
Long oldValue = map.get(word);
Long newValue = oldValue == null ? 1 : oldValue + 1;
map.put(word, newValue); // Error--might not replace oldValue
```
NOTE: Some programmers are surprised that a supposedly thread-safe data structure permits operations that are not thread safe. But there are two entirely different considerations. If multiple threads modify a plain HashMap, they can destroy the internal structure (an array of linked lists). Some of the links may go missing, or even go in circles, rendering the data structure unusable. That will never happen with a ConcurrentHashMap. In the example above, the code for get and put will never corrupt the data structure. But, since the sequence of operations is not atomic, the result is not predictable.

Use the `replace` operation to atomically replaces an old value with a new one.
```java
do {
    oldValue = map.get(word);
    newValue = oldValue == null ? 1 : oldValue + 1;
} while (!map.replace(word, oldValue, newValue));
```
Alternatively, use AtomicLong or LongAdder for ConcurrentHashMap.
```java
ConcurrentHashMap<String, AtomicLong> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); // or use ConcurrentHashMap<String,LongAdder>
map.putIfAbsent(word, new LongAdder());
map.get(word).increment();

// or
map.compute(word, (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);
```
#### 14.7.3 Bulk Operations on Concurrent Hash Maps
There are three kinds of operations:
* `search` applies a function to each key and/or value, until the function yields a non-null result. Then the search terminates and the function’s result is returned.
* `reduce` combines all keys and/or values, using a provided accumulation function.
* `forEach` applies a function to all keys and/or values.

Each operation has four versions:
* operationKeys: operates on keys.
* operationValues: operates on values.
* operation: operates on keys and values.
* operationEntries: operates on Map.Entry objects.

With each of the operations, you need to specify a `parallelism threshold`.
* If the map contains more elements than the threshold, the bulk operation is parallelized.
* If you want the bulk operation to run in a single thread, use a threshold of Long.MAX_VALUE.
* If you want the maximum number of threads to be made available for the bulk operation, use a threshold of 1.

```java
// find the first word that occurs more than 1,000 times.
String result = map.search(threshold, (k, v) -> v > 1000 ? k : null);
// for each, consumer
map.forEach(threshold, (k, v) -> System.out.println(k + " -> " + v));
// for each, an additional transformer function
map.forEach(threshold,
(k, v) -> k + " -> " + v, // Transformer
System.out::println); // Consumer
```
#### 14.7.4 Concurrent Set Views
There is no `ConcurrentHashSet` class. Instead, you can create concurrent set with map.
```java
// Prior to Java 8
Set<String> mySet = Collections.newSetFromMap(new ConcurrentHashMap<String, Boolean>());
// In Java 8
Set<String> myConcurrentSet = ConcurrentHashMap.<String>newKeySet();
```
#### 14.7.5 Copy on Write Arrays
CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet
#### 14.7.6 Parallel Array Algorithms
```java
String contents = new String(Files.readAllBytes(
    Paths.get("alice.txt")), StandardCharsets.UTF_8); // Read file into string
String[] words = contents.split("[\\P{L}]+"); // Split along nonletters
Arrays.parallelSort(words);
```
#### 14.7.7 Older Thread-Safe Collections
Vector and Hashtable are replaced by ArrayList and HashMap classes.
Any collection class can be made thread safe by means of a `synchronization wrapper`:
```java
List<E> synchArrayList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<E>());
Map<K, V> synchHashMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<K, V>());
```
### 14.8 Callables and Futures
A `Runnable` encapsulates a task that runs asynchronously; you can think of it as an asynchronous method with no parameters and no return value. A `Callable` is similar to a Runnable, but it returns a value. The Callable interface is a parameterized type, with a single method `call`.
```java
public interface Callable<V>
{
    V call() throws Exception; // V is the type of the returned value.
}
```

A `Future` holds the result of an asynchronous computation. The Future interface has the following methods:
```java
public interface Future<V>
{
    V get() throws . . .;
    V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws . . .;
    void cancel(boolean mayInterrupt);
    boolean isCancelled();
    boolean isDone();
}
```
### 14.9 Executors
If your program creates a large number of short-lived threads, it should use a `thread pool` instead.
Executors Factory Methods

Method                           | Description
---------------------------------|----------------------------
newCachedThreadPool              | New threads are created as needed; idle threads are kept for 60 seconds.
newFixedThreadPool               | The pool contains a fixed set of threads; idle threads are kept indefinitely.
newSingleThreadExecutor          | A “pool” with a single thread that executes the submitted tasks sequentially (similar to the Swing event dispatch thread).
newScheduledThreadPool           | A fixed-thread pool for scheduled execution; a replacement for java.util.Timer.
newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor | A single-thread “pool” for scheduled execution.

#### 14.9.1 Thread Pools
Here, in summary, is what you do to use a thread pool:
1. Call the static newCachedThreadPool or newFixedThreadPool method of the Executors class.
2. Call submit to submit Runnable or Callable objects.
3. If you want to be able to cancel a task, or if you submit Callable objects, hang on to the returned Future objects.
4. Call shutdown when you no longer want to submit any tasks.

```java
public static void main(String... args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException{
    //creates cached thread pool
    ExecutorService exService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    // runnable thread start to execute.
    exService.execute(new NewCachedThreadPoolTest().new RunnableThread());
    //callable thread starts to execute
    Future<Integer> future=exService.submit(new NewCachedThreadPoolTest().new CallableThread());
    //gets value of callable thread
    int val=future.get();
    System.out.println(val);
    //checks for thread termination
    boolean isTerminated=exService.isTerminated();
    System.out.println(isTerminated);
    // waits for termination for 30 seconds only
    exService.awaitTermination(30,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    exService.shutdownNow();
}

//Callable thread
class CallableThread implements Callable<Integer> {
    @Override
    public Integer call() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (; cnt < 5; cnt++) {
            System.out.println("call:" + cnt);
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}

//Runnable thread
class RunnableThread implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        int cnt = 0;
        for (; cnt < 5; cnt++) {
            System.out.println("run:" + cnt);
        }
    }
}
```
Output:
```sh
run:0
run:1
run:2
run:3
run:4
call:0
call:1
call:2
call:3
call:4
5
false
```
#### 14.9.3 Controlling Groups of Tasks
```java
List<Callable<T>> tasks = . . .;
List<Future<T>> results = executor.invokeAll(tasks); // A disadvantage of this approach is that you may wait needlessly if the first task happens to take a long time
for (Future<T> result : results) {
    processFurther(result.get());
}

// The service manages a blocking queue of Future objects, containing the results of the submitted tasks as they become available.
ExecutorCompletionService<T> service = new ExecutorCompletionService<>(executor);
for (Callable<T> task : tasks) {
    service.submit(task);
}
for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); i++) {
    processFurther(service.take().get());    
}

```
#### 14.9.4 The Fork-Join Framework
RecursiveTask<T>, RecursiveAction
Create an array with random numbers. Counter how many numbers are larger than 0.5.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int size = 1000000;
    double[] numbers = new double[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) numbers[i] = Math.random();
    Counter counter = new Counter(numbers, 0, numbers.length, new Filter() {
        public boolean accept(double x) {
            return x > 0.5;
        }
    });
    ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
    pool.invoke(counter);
    System.out.println(counter.join()); // output: 500305
}

interface Filter {
    boolean accept(double t);
}

static class Counter extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    public static final int THRESHOLD = 1000;
    private double[] values;
    private int from;
    private int to;
    private Filter filter;

    public Counter(double[] numbers, int i, int length, Filter filter) {
        this.values = numbers;
        this.from = i;
        this.to = length;
        this.filter = filter;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (to - from < THRESHOLD) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = from; i < to; i++) {
                if (filter.accept(values[i])) count++;
            }
            return count;
        } else {
            int mid = (from + to) / 2;
            Counter first = new Counter(values, from, mid, filter);
            Counter second = new Counter(values, mid, to, filter);
            invokeAll(first, second);
            return first.join() + second.join();
        }
    }
}
```
#### 14.9.5 Completable Futures
```java
CompletableFuture<String> contents = readPage(url);
CompletableFuture<List<URL>> links = contents.thenApply(Parser::getLinks); // only call the getLinks method when contents are available.
```
### 14.10 Synchronizers

Class            | What It Does | Notes
-----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------
CyclicBarrier    | Allows a set of threads to wait until a predefined count of them has reached a common barrier, and then optionally executes a barrier action.  | Use when a number of threads need to complete before their results can be used. The barrier can be reused after the waiting threads have been released.
Phaser           | Like a cyclic barrier, but with a mutable party count.  | Introduced in Java SE 7.
CountDownLatch   | Allows a set of threads to wait until a count has been decremented to 0.  | Use when one or more threads need to wait until a specified number of events have occurred.
Exchanger        | Allows two threads to exchange objects when both are ready for the exchange.  | Use when two threads work on two instances of the same data structure, with the first thread filling one instance and the second thread emptying the other.
Semaphore        | Allows a set of threads to wait until permits are available for proceeding.  | Use to restrict the total number of threads that can access a resource. If the permit count is one, use to block threads until another thread gives permission.
SynchronousQueue | Allows a thread to hand off an object to another thread. | Use to send an object from one thread to another when both are ready, without explicit synchronization.
