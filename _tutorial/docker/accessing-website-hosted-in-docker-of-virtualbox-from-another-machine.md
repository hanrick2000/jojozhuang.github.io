> Introduce how to access website hosted in docker of virtual machine from another machine.

## 1. VirtualBox + Docker
I'm assigned a task to find out how many customers have configured some specific validation rules in their production environment. What I have are the customization files fetched from server, they are in XML format. My idea is to use [OpenGrok](https://oracle.github.io/opengrok/) for search. Before using OpenGrok, we need to import these files to it. To make it reusable, I decide to setup OpenGrok in docker.

Steps:
* 1) Install VirtualBox on RedHat machine. RedHat is the host machine.
* 2) Install Ubuntu on VirtualBox. Ubuntu is the guest machine.
* 3) Create share folder between host and guest machine.
* 4) Install Docker in Ubuntu VM.
* 5) Create OpenGrok container.
* 6) Access OpenGrok from host machine.
* 7) Access OpenGrok from another machine.

## 2. Installation
### 2.1 Installing VirtualBox
Download proper VirtualBox for RedHat from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Then, install VirtualBox
```sh
sudo yum install VirtualBox-5.2-5.2.10_122088_el7-1.x86_64.rpm
```
Add yourself to the `vboxusers` group using the “Users and Groups” application or the command line:
```sh
sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers [your_user_name]
```
### 2.2 Installing Ubuntu VM
Go to https://ubuntu.com/#download to download Ubuntu Desktop. Refer to [Installing VirtualBox and Creating Ubuntu VM]({% link _tutorial/dev-env/installing-virtual-box-and-creating-ubuntu-vm.md %}) to install Ubuntu in virtual machine.
### 2.3 Creating Sharing Folder
First, create shared folder in host machine. Second, install VirtualBox Guest Additions for the Ubuntu VM. Devices -> Insert Guest Additions CD images..

Then, refer to [Sharing Files between Host and Guest in VirtualBox]({% link _tutorial/dev-env/sharing-files-between-host-and-guest-in-virtualbox.md %}) to connect the shared folder in host machine to guest machine.
Finally, the shared folder in RedHat locates in
```sh
/home/johnny/SharedUbuntu
```
The shared folder in Ubuntu VM locates in
```sh
/media/sf_SharedUbuntu
```
### 2.4 Installing Docker in Ubuntu VM
Refer to [Installing and Using Docker on Ubuntu]({% link _tutorial/docker/installing-and-using-docker-on-ubuntu.md %}) to install Docker.
### 2.5 Creating OpenGrok Container
Create two directories in the shared folder. Put the xml files into the `src` folder.
```sh
$ mkdir -p /opengrok/src /opengrok/data
```
* `src` - Contains your source files.
* `data` - Used by OpenGrok. OpenGrok will generate indexes for the source files and store them here.

Download OpenGrok Docker Image
```sh
docker pull scue/docker-opengrok
```
Run a Docker container and mount these two directories: src and data; this will automatically run indexing as a part of startup.
```sh
$ docker run --name=opengrok-cus1 -v /opengrok/src:/src -v /opengrok/data:/data -p 31030:8080 scue/docker-opengrok
```
The OpenGrok application is now running on http://localhost:31030/source/

### 2.6 Accessing OpenGrok from Host Machine
Stop Ubuntu VM, then click Settings, switch to Network. It already has the `NAT` Network Adapter in Adapter 1.

Switch to Adapter 2 tab, enable `Bridged Adapter`.
![image](/public/images/devops/3134/bridged.png)
Restart the Ubuntu VM. Go to Network to get the IP address `10.48.104.190` for bridged adapter.

Start the OpenGrok from docker. You may first need to delete the existing container created previously.

Show all existing containers.
```sh
docker ps -a
```
Remove one particular container with id.
```sh
docker rm [container id]
```
The OpenGrok application can be accessed through http://10.48.104.190:31030/source/

With the IP address, we can also access OpenGrok from host machine(RedHat).

### 2.7 Access OpenGrok from Another Machine
Stop Ubuntu VM, then click Settings, switch to Network. In `NAT` Network Adapter, click 'Port Forwarding' button. Setup Port Forwarding rule. `10.48.105.128` is the public IP address of the host machine. The following rule means, the request to http://10.48.105.128:31030 will be forwarded to http://10.48.104.190:31030.

Finally, the OpenGrok application can be accessed through http://10.48.105.128:31030/source/ from another machine.
