> Tutorial for how to create tomcat image with Dockerfile.

## 1. What is Dockerfile?
Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

## 2. What We've Done Until Now?
In posting [Serving JSP Application With Tomcat In Docker]({% link _tutorial/docker/serving-jsp-application-with-tomcat-in-docker.md %}) and [Enabling Tomcat Debugging in Docker for Eclipse]({% link _tutorial/docker/enabling-tomcat-debugging-in-docker-for-eclipse.md %}), we deployed the JSP Tutorial application to Tomcat container with enabling the remote debugging. Below is the command we used.
```sh
$ docker run --name=jsptomcat -d -v ~/Documents/jsptomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jsptutorial -p 31020:8080 -p 8000:8000 -e JPDA_ADDRESS=8000 tomcat catalina.sh jpda run
```
What is this command doing?
* Create a tomcat container named `jsptomcat`.
* Map local folder `~/Documents/jsptomcat` to `/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jsptutorial` in Tomcat container.
* Expose `8080` for outside world to connect to the website.
* Expose `8000` to enable remote debugging for tools like eclipse.
* Set environment variable `JPDA_ADDRESS` to 8000.
* Start tomcat via command `catalina.sh jpda run`.

In this posting, we will use Dockerfile to create a tomcat image with the same configuration mentioned above. Before moving forward, make sure youâ€™ve already setup folder ~/Documents/jsptomcat in local machine, which will be volumed to tomcat container later. And all jsp and class files have been deployed into this folder.

## 3. Creating Tomcat Image with Dockerfile
### 3.1 Creating Docker File
Create one file named `Dockerfile` in any directory on local machine.
```sh
$ cd ~/Johnny
$ mkdir DockerTomcat
$ cd DockerTomcat
$ vim Dockerfile
```
Edit Dockerfile, fill with following content.
```sh
#Create Tomcat Image for JSP Tutorial Application
FROM tomcat
MAINTAINER jojozhuang@gmail.com

ENV JPDA_ADDRESS 8000
EXPOSE 8000
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["catalina.sh", "jpda","run"]
CMD echo "jsptomcat is launched"
```
The following points need to be noted about the above file.
* The first line is a comment. You can add comments to the Docker File with the help of the # command
* The FROM keyword tells which base image you want to use. In our example, we are creating an image from the tomcat image.
* The next command is the person who is going to maintain this image.
* The ENV command is used to set environment variable. We set JPDA_ADDRESS to 8000 to enable remote debugging in tomcat container.
* The EXPOSE command exposes port of the image.
* The ENTRYPOINT command launch tomcat with running jpda for remote debugging. Notice, ENTRYPOINT only executes for container not image. To run command when creating image, use CMD keyword.
* The last line prints message to screen indicating container is running.

### 2.2 Creating Image with Dockerfile
Open Docker terminal, navigate to the folder where the Dockerfile locates. Run the following command.
```sh
$ docker build -t jsptomcat:0.2 .
```
Here, `jsptomcat` is the name we are giving to the Image and `0.2` is the tag number. The last dot `.` indicates the current location. Check whether the image is created.
```sh
$ docker images
```
As you see, the new image is created with tag 0.2.

## 3. Testing Tomcat Image
### 3.1 Running Container
In docker terminal, run the following command. (Make sure remove the tomcat container we created before.)
```sh
$ docker run --name=jsptomcat -d -v ~/Documents/jsptomcat:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jsptutorial -p 31020:8080 -p 8000:8000 jsptomcat:0.2
```
Notice we don't need to set the environment variable `JPDA_ADDRESS`, and execute `catalina.sh jpda run` any more. They are already set in the Dockerfile.
### 3.2 Verifying Container in Kitematic
A tomcat container named jsptomcat is running now. Notice, its source image is 'jsptomcat:0.2'. And environment variable JPDA_ADDRESS has been added to the container.

Port 8000 and port 8080 are also exposed.

Volume is also configured correctly.

### 3.3 Verifying JSP Tutorial Website
Access http://192.168.99.100:31020/jsptutorial/productlist.jsp in web browser. JSP Tutorial application is launched successfully!
![image](/public/images/devops/709/deployed.png)  

In Eclipse, enable debugging and set breakpoint to `productlist.jsp`. Refresh the page in web browser. Switch back to Eclipse, the breakpoint is activated. The remote debugging function is working now.
