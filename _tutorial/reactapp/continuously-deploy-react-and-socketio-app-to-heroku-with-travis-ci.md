> Deploy the course player app built with React and Socket.IO to Heroku with Travis-CI.

## 1. React & Socket.IO Project
### 1.1 Source Files
Download the source files for this course player app. Create your own repository on GitHub and submit this project.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojozhuang/course-player-react.git
```
### 1.2 Commands
In 'package.json', notice there is a command named 'start', which is used to launch the express server. Also, notice the 'test' command. It is empty as we don't need any testing for this app. Do not specify 'exit 1' in the end of this command. Otherwise, the deployment will fail.
```sh
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "NODE_ENV=development npm run open:src",
    ...
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\"",
  }
```
### 1.3 Travis Config File
In the root folder of the project, create a file named '.travis.yml'. Notice the app name is 'course-player-react'. Submit this file to GitHub.
```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "8"
sudo: false

branches:
  only:
  - master

cache:
  directories:
    - node_modules

install:
  - npm install

deploy:
  provider: heroku
  skip_cleanup: true
  keep-history: true
  api-key:
    secure: $HEROKU_API_KEY
  app: course-player-react
```

## 2. Heroku
