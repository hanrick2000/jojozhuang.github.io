> Introduce how to deploy Code Editor app built with React and Express to Heroku.

## 1. Full Stack App
In the posting [Building Online Code Editor with React and Express]({% link _tutorial/reactapp/building-online-code-editor-with-react-and-express.md %}), I introduced how to build an online code editor with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). In this posting, I will introduce how to deploy both the front end(Implemented with React) and the backend(Implemented with express) to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). We will create two sites on Heroku. One is for the React app and another is for the express app.
### 1.1 Deployment Preparation for API Server
Nothing needs to be done for the express, as there is no database connection required, no need to set db url.
### 1.2 Deployment Preparation for React
Edit 'webpack.parts.js', use `DefinePlugin` to set api url to environment variable 'API_URL'.
```javascript
...

const webpack = require('webpack');

exports.loadEnv = url => ({
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env': {
        API_URL: JSON.stringify(url)
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
Edit 'webpack.config.js', call 'loadEnv()' method to set URL for production and development.
```javascript
const productionConfig = merge([
  parts.loadEnv('https://code-editor-api.herokuapp.com'),

  ...

]);
const developmentConfig = merge([
  parts.loadEnv('http://localhost:8080'),

  ...

]);
```
Edit 'package.json', add 'build' command to compile React app and output to 'dist'.
```javascript
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/server/index.js",
  "build": "webpack --env production ",
  "client":
    "PORT=3000 webpack-dev-server --env development --devtool inline-source-map --hot",
  "client-prod": "PORT=3001 webpack-dev-server",
  "server": "nodemon src/server/index.js",
  "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
  "prod": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client-prod\""
},
```
* Notice, command 'prod' is used to test React app in production mode. The dropdown list should only contains two options: javascript and python in this mode.

## 2. Heroku
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
### 2.1 Sign Up
Go to https://signup.heroku.com/ create a free Heroku account.
### 2.2 Installing Heroku CLI
Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install to download proper installer.
### 2.3 Getting Started
First, read the official tutorial [Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction) to get familiar with the basic functions of Heroku. Below are some of the highlights from the tutorial.  
1) Log into Heroku
```sh
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: jojozhuang@gmail.com
Password: **********
```
2) Create Heroku App
```sh
$ heroku create                   // no name, a random name will be assigned to the app
$ heroku create code-editor-api   // create app with the given name
```
3) View logs
```sh
$ heroku logs --tail
```
4) Scale the app
```sh
$ heroku ps //check how many dynos are running
$ heroku ps:scale web=0 // scale down
$ heroku ps:scale web=1 // scale up
```
5) Run the app locally
```sh
$ heroku local web // same as 'npm start'
```
6) Heroku Console
```sh
$ heroku run bash
Running bash on â¬¢ damp-springs-52045... up, run.3598 (Free)
~ $ ls
Procfile  README.md  app.json  index.js  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json	public	test.js  views
```
* Type 'exit' to quit the console.

## 3. Deployment
### 3.1 Server
1) Clone Source Code
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jojozhuang/code-editor-react
$ cd code-editor-react
```
2) Create App on Heroku
```sh
$ heroku create code-editor-api
```
* When creating an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with the local git repository.

3) Push files to Heroku
```sh
$ git push heroku master
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 68.86 KiB | 6.89 MiB/s, done.
Total 7 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Compressing source files... done.
remote: Building source:
remote:
remote: -----> Node.js app detected
remote:
remote: -----> Build failed
remote:  !     Two different lockfiles found: package-lock.json and yarn.lock
remote:
remote:        Both npm and yarn have created lockfiles for this application,
remote:        but only one can be used to install dependencies. Installing
remote:        dependencies using the wrong package manager can result in missing
remote:        packages or subtle bugs in production.
remote:
remote:        - To use npm to install your application's dependencies please delete
remote:          the yarn.lock file.
remote:
remote:          $ git rm yarn.lock
remote:
remote:        - To use yarn to install your application's dependences please delete
remote:          the package-lock.json file.
remote:
remote:          $ git rm package-lock.json
remote:     
remote:        https://kb.heroku.com/why-is-my-node-js-build-failing-because-of-conflicting-lock-files
remote:
remote:  !     Push rejected, failed to compile Node.js app.
remote:
remote:  !     Push failed
remote: Verifying deploy....
remote:
remote: !	Push rejected to code-editor-api.
remote:
To https://git.heroku.com/code-editor-api.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/code-editor-api.git'
```
Error occurs, we need to decide whether to use `npm` or `yarn` to manage dependencies. Notice that when the React App was created, both yarn lock file `yarn.lock` and npm lock file `package-lock.json` were generated. I decide to use npm, so remove yarn.lock from git staging and try to push again.
```sh
$ git rm yarn.lock
rm 'yarn.lock'
$ git commit -m "remove yarn.lock"
[master 7944b7d] remove yarn.lock
 1 file changed, 7423 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 yarn.lock
$ git push heroku master
```
If you changed the app name or you are deploying new changes. You need to re-connect your git repository to Heroku app.
```sh
$ git remote rm heroku
$ heroku git:remote -a code-editor-api
```
4) Testing Server  
Open web browser, access 'https://code-editor-api.herokuapp.com/api'. The API is working now.

If we access https://code-editor-api.herokuapp.com/api/file/Java, it returns some java source codes.

### 3.2 Client
1) Build react app.
```sh
$ npm run build
```
The React app is built and exported to dist folder. All are static files(html, js and images).
![image](/public/images/frontend/424/build.png){:width="800px"}  
2) Create App on Heroku
```sh
$ heroku create code-editor
```
3) Create git repository.
```sh
$ cd dist
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial"
$ git push heroku master
```
If you changed the app name or you are deploying new changes. You need to re-connect your git repository to Heroku app.
```sh
$ git remote rm heroku
$ heroku git:remote -a code-editor
```
4) Testing Server  
Open web browser, access 'https://code-editor.herokuapp.com/'. The React app is working now.
![image](/public/images/frontend/424/client.png)
* Notice, because the Client Side Routing doesn't work properly, I changed to the router rules to show editor in the root path /.

In addition, notice that c, c++ and java are not supported in Heroku or Netlify. I got the CORS error when trying to execute java program.
![image](/public/images/frontend/424/cors_error.png)
So these three languages are removed from the dropdown list in production mode. They are only available in dev mode, locally.

## 4. Heroku UI
### 4.1 Dashboard
Log into Heroku and go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/. The dashboard shows all the app we have created.

### 4.2 Overview
Click one of the app and check the overview.

### 4.3 Deploy
In the deploy tab, notice that we can connect GitHub and deploy projects.
