> Introduce how to deploy React application to Netlify.

## 1. Netlify
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is an online service which builds, deploys, and manages modern web projects.  Netlify basically initiates its own kind of repository that pushes both to a Github repository and its own services. It offers hosting for front-end projects with many options.

## 2. Deploying Application From Github Repository
In this tutorial, I will deploy my [Game Store React](https://github.com/jojozhuang/game-store-react) app to Netlify.
### 2.1 New Netlify Account
Go to https://app.netlify.com/signup to create a Netlify account with your GitHub account.
### 2.2 New Site from GitHub
After login, you are in the app home page, click 'New site from Git'.

Choose 'Github', next.

Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account, next.

Choose the repository 'game-store-react', next.

Choose `master` for the Branch to deploy, set `npm run build` to the Build command, and set `dist` to the Publish directory, click the 'Deploy site' button.

Netlify will start to deploy your site.

Switch to 'Deploy' tab to monitor the status and check the logs.

If the deployment fails, click on the FAILED build, check the log and you should see the error in details.

If no issue occurs, the publish will be done after few seconds(or minutes).

### 2.3 Testing
Switch back to the 'Overview' tab, click on the green link.

Our app is now running in the domain of Netlify.

However, we got 'Page Not found' error when access the 'products' page. The same error occurs when access the 'productpage' page.

Actually, I've already discussed this issue in tutorial [React Router and Client Side Routing]({% link _tutorial/react-app/react-router-and-client-side-routing.md %}).
### 2.4 Fixing the Issue
To solve this React Routing issue on Netlify, we need to handling redirects for single page apps, see below. Read more about it in [Netlify Document](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/#history-pushstate-and-single-page-apps).

Create a file named '\_redirects' to the 'public' folder of the React project with the following content.
```raw
/*    /index.html   200
```
Then we need this file to be copied to 'dist' folder when building. To do so, we can use library 'copy-webpack-plugin'.
```raw
npm i -D copy-webpack-plugin
```
Edit 'webpack.parts.js', add the following codes.
```javascript
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

exports.loadStatic = () => ({
  plugins: [
    new CopyWebpackPlugin([
      {
        from: "./public/_redirects",
        to: "./_redirects",
        toType: "file"
      }
    ])
  ]
});
```
Edit 'webpack.config.js', call 'loadStatic' method in production merge.
```javascript
const productionConfig = merge([
  // parts.loadEnv('https://online-code-editor-api.herokuapp.com'),
  parts.extractCSS({
    use: "css-loader"
  }),

  ...

  parts.loadStatic()
]);
```
Run 'npm run build'. The '\_redirects' file is copied from './public' folder to the root folder of 'dist'.

In Netlify, switch to 'Deploy' tab, click the 'Trigger Deploy' button to deploy again.
![image](/assets/images/frontend/2614/triggerdeploy.png)
After the deployment is finished, retry to access the 'products' page, it's working now.
![image](/assets/images/frontend/2614/worked.png)
The 'Add Product' page also works now.

### 2.5 Changing Site Name
Switch to Settings tab, scroll down and click the 'Change site name' button.
![image](/assets/images/frontend/2614/settings.png)
Change the name to 'game-store-react' and save.

Access your site with the new URL, it should work.

### 2.6 Hot Module Replacement Error
In addition, I got the following HMR issue somehow after I changed the build command.
```raw
VM72 bundle.js:16 Uncaught Error: locals[0] does not appear to be a `module` object with Hot Module replacement API enabled. You should disable react-transform-hmr in production by using `env` section in Babel configuration. See the example in README: https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr
```
![image](/assets/images/frontend/2614/hmr.png)
The below 'build' command triggers this HMR issue.
```javascript
"build": "webpack --env production ",
```
To fix the issue, add 'NODE_ENV=production' into the build command. Submit the change to Github, Netlify will automatically deploy again, and the HMR issue should be solved.
```javascript
"build": "NODE_ENV=production webpack --env production ",
```
