> Introduce client side routing and how to fix the issue when using React Router.

## 1. Routing Issue
When using [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for my React app, I encountered a routing issue. When accessing the homepage http://localhost:3000/, everything looks fine.

However, when clicking on the Code Editor button, we are navigated to http://localhost:3000/editor. The routing is not working, instead, "Cannot GET /URL Error" appears.

## 2. Client Side Routers
In the old days, things were simple. If you wanted to get the contents of /dashboard, the browser would make a GET request to your server, by inspecting the path portion of the URL the server would figure out that the user was requesting the /dashboard page. It would then grab that page and send back to the browser as a response. Then these things called client side routers (CSR) came into the picture. With a CSR (like React Router), youâ€™re no longer making requests to your server every time you change routes. Instead, your CSR is just handling that for you locally on the browser. So when you go to /dashboard, instead of making a GET request to your server, your CSR is using a browser API called history.pushState to manually change the URL and then it renders the View for that specific route - all without causing a page refresh.

## 3. Solutions
The solution is to force web browser access the index page. This can be done at server side.
### 3.1 Webpack-Dev-Server
Add `publicPath` and `historyApiFallback` into the webpack configuration.
```javascript
publicPath: '/',
historyApiFallback: true,
```
Sample `webpack.config.js`.
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin');

const outputDirectory = 'dist';

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/client/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, outputDirectory),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    publicPath: '/',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  devServer: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true,
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:8080',
    },
    historyApiFallback: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin([outputDirectory]),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
      favicon: './public/favicon.ico',
    }),
  ],
};
```
Rebuild with webpack and refresh the browser. You may need to clean web browser cache.

### 3.2 Nginx Server
Add following line to the Nginx configuration file /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.
```sh
try_files $uri /index.html;
```
This lets nginx serve static asset files and serves your index.html file when any file isn't found on the server.
```raw
server {
    listen       9096;
    server_name  localhost;

    #charset koi8-r;

    #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
        root   /nginx/www;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }
```
