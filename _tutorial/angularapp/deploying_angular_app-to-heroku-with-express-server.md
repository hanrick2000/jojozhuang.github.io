> Introduce how to deploy Game Store Angular app to Heroku and run in express server.

## 1. Angular Project
### 1.1 Source Files
Download the source files for this Angular app. Create your own repository on GitHub and submit this project.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jojozhuang/game-store-angular.git
```
### 1.2 Post Install
Add `postinstall` script to have the build command run after the dependencies have been installed. With this postinstall script in place, we'll get a production mode app that lives in a `dist` folder with `ahead of time(AOT)` compilation, all on the server. No need to build the app locally.
```javascript
// package.json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "postinstall": "ng build --aot --prod"
},
```
### 1.3 Move the @angular/cli Dependency
Heroku will only install the packages listed in the `dependencies` object and will ignore those in `devDependencies`. Since we want the application build step to take place on the server rather than on our local machine, we need to adjust the `package.json` file a bit. Angular CLI apps put the `@angular/cli` module itself as a dev dependency, meaning that we won't be able to access any `ng` commands on the server. To get around this, we need to move it to dependencies.
```javascript
// package.json
"dependencies": {
  // ...
  "@angular/cli": "7.3.9",
},
```
### 1.4 Engines
It's better to use same version of nodejs and npm during development and production. Add the specific Node and npm versions in the `engines` key in package.json. This is helpful for preventing unanticipated behavior due to version issues.
```javascript
// package.json
"engines": {
  "node": "9.4.0",
  "npm": "6.9.0"
}
```
### 1.5 Running the Server
Later on, we’re going to create a simple Node server to actually serve the application. We need to specify how the app should be started in a script so that Heroku can boot up the application server at the end of the deployment process. Create `start` command in scripts.
```javascript
// package.json
"scripts": {
  // ...
  "start": "node server.js"
},
```
### 1.6 Create an Express Server
Install express.
```sh
npm install --save express
```
Create `server.js` with following content.
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Run the app by serving the static files
// in the dist directory
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/dist'));
// Start the app by listening on the default
// Heroku port
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 12080);
```
The `start` script is the last one to be called in the deployment process. The postinstall script will run beforehand, so we'll have all the files built and ready to go in the `dist` directory.
### 1.7 Force Redirect to HTTPS
Make all requests for the application be redirected to `https`.
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// If an incoming request uses
// a protocol other than HTTPS,
// redirect that request to the
// same url but with HTTPS
const forceSSL = function() {
  return function (req, res, next) {
    if (req.headers['x-forwarded-proto'] !== 'https') {
      return res.redirect(
       ['https://', req.get('Host'), req.url].join('')
      );
    }
    next();
  }
}
// Instruct the app
// to use the forceSSL
// middleware
app.use(forceSSL());
// ...
```
### 1.8 Handle PathLocationStrategy Routing
When we punch in the domain and a sub-route for our Angular app in the URL bar and hit enter, the GET request made to the server tries to serve a path that doesn't exist. Instead, we need to tell the server to always serve the index.html file for any GET request that comes in for any route. This will allow Angular to handle the routing instead of the server. Now when we navigate directly to a sub-route (instead of clicking our way there in the app), the route will be served as expected.
```javascript
// server.js
const path = require('path');
// ...
// For all GET requests, send back index.html
// so that PathLocationStrategy can be used
app.get('/*', function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/dist/index.html'));
});
```

## 2. Deployment
Switch to root directory of the app.
```sh
cd game-store-angular/
```
Create new app.
```sh
$ heroku create game-store-angular
Creating ⬢ game-store-angular... done
https://game-store-angular.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/game-store-angular.git
```
Or connect to the existing app.
```sh
heroku git:remote -a game-store-angular
```
Then push all files to heroku.
```sh
$ git push heroku master
