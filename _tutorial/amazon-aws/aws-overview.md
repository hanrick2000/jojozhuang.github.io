S3 Summary:
* S3 is Object-based.
* Files can be form 0 Bytes to 5TB.
* There is unlimited storage.
* Files are stored in Buckets.
* S3 is a universal namespace. That is, names must be unique globally.
* Example Bucket url: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/johnnyawsguru-s3-01
* Not suitable to install an operating system on.
* Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code.

Key Fundamentals of S3:
* Key(This is simply the name of the object)
* Value(This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes).
* Version ID(Important for versioning)
* Metadata(Data about data you are storing)
* Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propagate)
