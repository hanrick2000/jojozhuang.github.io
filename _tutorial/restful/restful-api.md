> Setup a dummy server to provide fake data as RESTful APIs.

## 1. RESTful APIs
When developing web application, we properly need RESTful APIs to provide some JSON data to the front-end application. It takes some time to build a full backend server, e.g. by using ASP.NET Web APIs or Spring Boot as I introduced in the previous postings. Actually, another option is to setup a dummy server to provide dummy data as RESTful service.
