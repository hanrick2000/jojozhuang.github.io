> Tutorial for remove security vulnerabilities for node js apps.

## 1. Warning from GitHub
For some of the repositories on GitHub, we get the warning 'We found a potential security vulnerability in one of your dependencies.'

## 2. Vulnerability Detection
Use 'npm audit' to scan your Node.js app and detect any security vulnerability. To use it, you must upgrade 'npm' to version 6.
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
Go to the root folder of the app, run 'npm audit'. It will list out the vulnerable dependencies.
```sh
npm audit
```

In the end, it shows the summary of the security vulnerabilities. In the example, we see there is one 'high' level vulnerability.

## 3. Removing Vulnerability
Run the following command to automatically install compatible updates to vulnerable dependencies. In the below example, it fixed 9 of 15 vulnerabilities.
```sh
npm audit fix
```
![image](/public/images/frontend/2504/fixed.png){:width="700px"}  
Run the command again, we see there are still 6 vulnerable dependencies. However, there is no 'high' level vulnerability anymore.
```sh
npm audit
```

* If you want to fix more vulnerabilities, you may run the following commands or fix them manually. For example, to fix the vulnerability in `hoek` package, just run 'npm install hoek' to install the latest version of hoek.
```sh
npm audit fix --force
npm upgrade
```
Submit all the changes to GitHub, the warning should be gone.

## 4. Final Solution
```sh
# upgrade angular
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng update @angular/core
ng update @angular/cli --migrate-only --from=1.7.3
ng update

# upgrade react
npm install --save react@latest

# update packages
npm update
npm install

```
