> Unable to run perl script if module is not found.

## 1. Error
When trying to execute a perl script, I got the following error. The error shows that perl cannot find the required module.
```raw
$ perl encryptionoptin.pl
Can't locate InstalledProduct.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
```

## 2. Cause
The error is either because the module is not installed or its path is not in the @INC list.

## 3. Solution
### 3.1 Checking Directories
Use `perl -V` to check the @INC list. Note, V is upper case.
```raw
perl -V

...

    /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.10/site/lib
    /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.10/lib
```

### 3.2 Import Module
One approach to solve this error is to use `-I` option to manually import the module.
```raw
$ perl -I /Users/Johnny/project/InstalledProduct.pm  encryptionoptin.pl
```
