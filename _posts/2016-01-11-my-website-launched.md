Finally, I have my own personal website and it has blog function, pretty cool! It takes me two days to set up the whole website and another few days to fill in the contents. It is responsive, which means I can view it not only from desktop or laptop, but also from mobile devices. If you are also interested in creating your own website, please refer to the [About](/about/) page to get more details.  

From now on, I will post blogs to share my stories, experiences and thoughts with you. Welcome to my online home!
