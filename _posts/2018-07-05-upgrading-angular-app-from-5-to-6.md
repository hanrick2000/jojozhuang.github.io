> Upgrade Angular App from 5 to 6

## 1. Angular 5 Vs Angular 6
Angular 6 was released on May 4th, 2018. That is 6 months after its predecessor's (Angular 5) release. The highlights of Angular 6 include the Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), The Component Development KIT (CDK) and the Angular Material package update.

## 2. Upgrade
### 2.1 Upgrade Angular CLI
Update Angular CLI from globally. In my local, Angular CLI is upgraded from 1.7.4 to 6.1.3.
```sh
npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```
Update Angular CLI dev. Go to the root folder of the Angular project, then run following commands.
```sh
npm uninstall --save-dev angular-cli
npm install --save-dev @angular/cli@latest
npm install
```
### 2.2 Upgrade Angular Core 5 to Angular 6
```sh
ng update @angular/core
```
* Note, after upgrading, `.angular-cli.json` will be deleted, instead, `angular.json` will be created.

Install all related packages.
```sh
npm install
```

## 3. Angular Starter
Use Starter to Create new Project, read details at [Angular Webpack Starter](https://github.com/gdi2290/angular-starter).
