> Introduce how to create Jenkins container in Docker.

## 1. What is Jenkins?
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/index.html) is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on. It is a free source that can handle any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies.

## 2. Creating Jenkins Container in Docker
### 2.1 Installing Docker and Kitematic
If you havenâ€™t installed Docker and Kitematic, please install Docker Toolbox by referring to another posting [Installing Docker Toolbox and Kitematic on Mac]({% link _tutorial/docker/installing-docker-toolbox-and-kitematic-on-mac.md %}).
### 2.2 Creating Jenkins Container
Search jenkins in Kitematic, select the official image, and click Create button.

Open container terminal by clicking on the 'EXEC' button in Kitematic. Run the following commands to get the password from secret file `initialAdminPassword`.
```raw
