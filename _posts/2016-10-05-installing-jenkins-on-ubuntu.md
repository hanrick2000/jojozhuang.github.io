> Introduce how to install Jenkins on Ubuntu.

## 1. What is Jenkins?
[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/index.html) is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on. It is a free source that can handle any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies.

## 2. Installing Jenkins
To use Jenkins, you can either install it on a physical/virtual machine, or create Jenkins container in Docker.
### 2.1 Installing and Setting up Jenkins on Ubuntu
Go to [https://jenkins.io/download/](https://jenkins.io/download/), choose 'Ubuntu/Debian' for Long-term Support (LTS) version. Follow the steps mentioned in the page.  
1) Add the key to your system:
```sh
$ wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
```
2) Open /etc/apt/sources.list with editor:
```sh
$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Add the following entry to the end.
```sh
$ deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/
```
3) Update your local packages, then finally install Jenkins:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
After running above command, this package installation will:
* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. See /etc/init.d/jenkins for more details.
* Create a jenkins user to run this service.
* Direct console log output to the file /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
* Populate /etc/default/jenkins with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g JENKINS_HOME
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

### 2.2 Launching Jenkins Web
Open a web browser, access http://localhost:8080/. You need to find the password in the given file to unlock Jenkins.

In terminal, navigate to the given directory.
```sh
$ cd /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/
```
If you encounter the permission denied error, use 'sudo su' command (without another user name) to allow you to run commands as the super-user (root).

```sh
$ nano initialAdminPassword
```
