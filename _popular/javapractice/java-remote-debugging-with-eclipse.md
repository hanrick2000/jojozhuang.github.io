> Tutorial for how to remote debugging with Eclipse.

## 1. Introduction
In the posting [Using Java Debugger]({% link _popular/javapractice/using-java-debugger.md %}), we learned how to debug a Java application with Java debugger (JDB). In this posting, I will introduce how to debug the same Java application in Eclipse, which would be much easier and more convenient than using JDB.

## 2. Debugging in Eclipse
### 2.1 Preparing Project
In Eclipse, create a new Java Project. Add one class named `Sum.java` into the project with following content.
```java
public class Sum {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int val1 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        int val2 = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
        int sum = val1 + val2;
        System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);
    }
}
```
Set breakpoints to line 3 and line 6 in Sum.java.

### 2.2 Creating Debug Configuration
In Eclipse, Run -> Debug Configurations..., create a new 'Remote Java Application' named `Sum Debugging`. Specify the Host to `localhost` and Port to `4000`.

### 2.3 Compiling and Running
Open terminal, navigate to the folder where Sum.java locates, use `javac` to compile it. The `g` option adds extra debug info to the class.
```sh
$ javac -g Sum.java
```
Run `Sum` in debug mode with providing two input parameters, 3 and 4. Now we have the application listening on port 4000 waiting for connections.
```sh
$ java -Xdebug -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=4000,server=y,suspend=y Sum 3 4
```
* With `suspend=y` the Java-process will wait until the debugger connects, with suspend=n you will be also able to debug the application servers startup process.
* The option `server=y` opens a socket and listens for incoming debugger requests. With server=n the debugged application will try to connect actively to a debugger and run therefore as a client.

### 2.4 Debugging
In Eclipse, click the `Debug As..` button on toolbar and select `Sum Debugging`.

You will see the debugging is working now. The first breakpoint is activated.

Click the `Step Over` button(F6) in the tool bar to step the execution to the next line. Meanwhile, you see the values of local variables are changing.

Step over line 6 and switch to the terminal. The result is just printed out in the terminal.

Click the `Resume` button(F8), the debugging session ends in Eclipse. Meanwhile, the debug process ends in terminal.
