> A WP App for searching SAP & ERP related words, built in C#.

## 1. Function
You can use it as a dictionary to search word from SAP area. Three options:  
* Glossary: Index by Alphabets
* Search: Search with input text
* 3-Character Classic: Search abbreviation word

Two languages are supported, English and German. There is a light-weight dictionary installed in the phone along with the app. This local dictionary contains partial data, and is stored in [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) database. Besides, there is a web server(built with ASP.Net) which provides service to feed full dictionary data. In case no result is matched from the local database, the app will connect to this web API for further search.
