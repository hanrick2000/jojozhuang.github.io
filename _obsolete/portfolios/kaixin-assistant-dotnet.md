> This desktop application is not for work, but for fun.

## 1. Background
It is a 'tag-on' program used to automatically play flash games for [Kaixin001](http://www.kaixin001.com/ "Kaixin001")(A Chinese social website, like Facebook). When this website was popular, many people were addicted to some interactive games, like, garden planting, fishing, farming and cooking. Normally, you have to open your web browser, login to the website, open the specific game and do some operations to play it. Besides, you have to spend much effort if you want to get high scores. With this tool, however, you can get rid of the boring, repetitive operations and still play better than others. What you need to do is just to open this tool, configure it and run.

Technically, it simulates your manual operations on the web pages or flash, sends out HTTP GET/POST requests to the server, and gets result to do the next operations.
